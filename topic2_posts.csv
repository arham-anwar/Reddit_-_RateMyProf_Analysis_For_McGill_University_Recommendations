"Seeking syllabus from 1996-97 for ENGL 275 (full-year course) Hi all, this is a long shot but I am trying to find the syllabus for a course I took in 1996-97. It was ENGL [110-]275D, Communications &amp; Literature. At the time it was a full-year (two-term, six-credit) course.

(Basically this is important to me now because I'm going for an ""after-degree"" program and if I can find the said syllabus it'll mean I can avoid doing a certain course in the near future.)


The class was pretty big -- IIRC, it was given in Leacock 132 -- and it was required for the Cultural Studies in English program.

I know ENGL 275 still exists but because it's now a three-credit course, I'm told the syllabus for the new version of the course will be useless in this situation because it'll be too different.

I am in touch with the professor who gave the course back then and she says she's digging through her stuff to see if she has it. If she doesn't, though, I'm going to want to try other means to get it. 

Please let me know if you can lend a hand, or know somebody who might!

UPDATE: The English department was able to send me a .pdf of an outline and it might be enough. Nice.",0

"Algebra and analysis Is taking Algebra 1/2 and Analysis 1/2 at the same time a bad idea? I've heard it's quite a lot of work, especially if you're taking even more math classes on top of that. I'm in U1 math right now, but switched majors from last semester so I have to take algebra and analysis in U2/U3. Analysis isn't a prereq for any other math courses (except analysis 3/4 obviously) so I could get away with taking it in U3 if that would lighten up my course load.

I am looking for some advice on which of these two courses you would recommend. I am one class away from finishing a Bio minor that I don't really enjoy unfortunately, but it's too late to do anything about that now, and I've narrowed down my options to these two courses next Fall. I really hated BIOL 200 and 201, I loved 202, and I am currently in 303 and it's decent. I'm thinking that from this description 370 sounds like the better option, but I did really enjoy the cancer portion of 202, which is what initially got me considering 314.

"Course registration questions Hello r/mcgill, you guys have really helped me a lot in the past with answering the doubts I had in a post. However, I now have some issues related to course registration. 

I would like to take Honours Mathematics and possibly a CS Minor (I'm not sure between the CS Minor or the Physics Minor. Topics such as Astrophysics or Relativity seem extremely interesting to me, but I think that the CS Minor will be more useful). The courses which I plan to take for the fall term are the following: MATH 150, MATH 133, PHYS 131 and CHEM 110. What worries me is the fact that I'll take MATH 150 and PHYS 131, are they considered difficult courses? Keep in mind that I had decent grades in HS in Math, Physics and Chemistry (and also took high school calculus in the form of IB Math SL). On the other hand, should I choose MATH 134 instead of MATH 133? Will this hurt my GPA? And finally, is it a wise move if i want to take Honours Maths?

Moving on to the next point, for the winter term I am interested on the following courses: MATH 150, PHYS 142, COMP 202. This leaves me with one elective. Should I take a course which counts towards my degree requirements or an arts elective? Moreover, do you guys think that it would be better taking COMP 202 on the fall term or on the winter term? Nonetheless, this means that I won't be able to take any Chemistry courses. 

Finally, a question regarding the VSB, what does ""x of the y sections self-conflict"" mean? Does this mean that I won't be able to take those two courses? 

Excuse me if some of the questions seem stupid, but I'm worried about my academic future! This is a completely new experience to me, considering that i'm an intl student. ",0

"Simple question for students: For a particular course, would you rather have no texts, or lots of texts? Assume the course lecture content is the same, and there is sufficient information in the lecture that you obtain the gist of the intended content . 

With that, the professor can assign you $250 worth of books --  a reading list which has a lot of content relevant to the course you're enrolled in, but you only need let's say 10% of each of the books.   The upside here is that you will then have a really great set of books on the subject of the course; if you are diligent, you will get a more rounded view of the topic, either while you are enrolled, or later on, as summer reading, say.  

Or the professor can assign you no texts, and you get the content directly from the lectures/notes/recordings.  Cost: $0.

FALL: MATH 150, MATH 134, PHYS 131, MATH 338.
WINTER: MATH 151, PHYS 142, COMP 202, MUAR 201.

Can I handle MATH 338 in my first term? I think I'll be okay with the rest. I think I am exempted from CHEM 110/120 due to advanced standing credits, I don't need to take BIOL courses because I am in physical sciences.",0
"upper level stats classes for someone who took MATH 203/204 hi everyone, 

i'm interested in possibly pursuing a masters in epidemiology after doing some research in that area. i took math 203/204 and i did well in both classes. does anyone know what i can do in terms of stats classes after MATH 204, or what classes would be good preparation before a masters in epidemiology? i'm in computer science and biology!

"Switching Majors After Second Year (Calling All Econ Majors!) So, I recently made the decision to switch one of my majors from Cultural Studies to Economics (my other major is Poli Sci). I've never taken an Econ course at McGill before (or anywhere for that matter), but I'm very interested in the subject matter and maintain an active interest in news related to the economy. Since I have essentially two years to complete an entire major, I'm trying to make my schedule as efficent as possible. 

My questions are these: 

1. Is it necessary to take 208 (Micro Analysis and Application) and 209 (Macro Analysis and Application) to understand what's happening in 230 (Micro Theory) and 330 (Macro Theory)?  I know that 208/9 don't count towards the major, but I don't want to get into those theory classes with the standing assumption that everybody already knows the concepts from 208/9.

2. Is it possible to take 230 and 330 in the same year? I know that 230 is a pre-req for 330, but 208 is a pre-req for 209 and everybody suggests ignoring that. Also, from what I understand, The concepts in Micro and Macro are different enough to not have much overlap, and the reason why Micro is taught first is because its concepts are generally more intuitive. 

3. Does an course load for the year of Econ 208,209,230,330 and 227 (Econ Stats) seem reasonable, redundant, or literally and figuratively insane? Is it even possible? This seems like the best way to get a concentrated dose of that sweet sweet economic goodness, but I'm admittedly pretty naive about what kind of workload Econ courses entail.

I'd really appreciate any advice or information you guys have. Thanks!",0
"Questions about Microbiology &amp; Immunology program I'm entering U1, but this is my first year so I'm really nervous about u1 science courses (and university in general!). I've already seen loads written about courses that pretty much all life science students take in u1 (such as biol 200, bioc 212 etc) but I can't find much about the mimm courses. I have to take Mimm 211, Mimm 212 lab and in the winter I have to take Mimm 214. Does anyone have any advice on how to do well in these courses? Are they memorization based or more concept based? I've heard many people say microbiology is one of the harder majors so I've been having second thoughts. Any input would be appreciated. You can also pm me if you have opinions!",0

"Honors ODE instead of regular Hi everyone! (I posted this on a fb group already so I apologize if you're seeing this twice)

I have a question for the math/physics people of r/mcgill. I normally won't be asking for prof suggestions but I'm having quite the dilemma...

I'll be taking MATH 223 (Prof TBA) and MATH 222 in the fall w/ Jian-Jun Xu (who is apparently known as a not-so-good prof... I don't normally follow Ratemyprof but he has 1.7 w/ 80 reviews....) and he's also teaching 315 in the winter, which I'm currently registered for.

QUESTION:
How terrible of an idea is it to maybe take Honors ODE (with Humphries) in place of MATH 223 in the Fall and take 223 in the winter instead?? I've heard great things about Humphries and I'm willing to put in the extra effort to catch up compared to regular ODE..I'm only doing this to avoid Jian-Jun and hopefully have a better experience with ODE. I've also been advised to take ODE alongside PHYS 230, as it pops up often.

Alternative: I take regular ODE with Roth in the Fall.
I'd like to experience 1 Honors class at McGill and I feel like this isn't a bad place to start.....(?)

Any advice or past experience with any of these profs would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! :)",0

I'm a U0 Arts student and have browsed pretty much all of /r/mcgill's pages on arts courses/electives.

I know not many people opt for 151, but was wondering if anyone had any experience with it. Would taking math 222 concurrently, along with math 133, be alright? The reason I ask is become online it says that material will be covered from 130, 131, 140, 141 and 222. I like math, and love when courses overlap in slightly differing ways, but don't want to be too overwhelmed. 

Thanks very much!",0

"Need help figuring out my courses Hello McGill reddit! 

I'm a U1 Software Engineering student in Engineering. I have a lot of questions so please bear with me.

I got a grade of D for MATH263, but a D is considered a Fail for Engineering core classes. As I understand it, I must drop the MATH270 course I am currently enrolled in for Winter 2015 and sign up for MATH263, but all the sections are full. Am I supposed to continuously check back on VSB or Minerva for open spots or can I contact someone in Engineering to squeeze me in? Also does a grade of D in Engineering grant me 0 GPA or is it higher?

I plan on applying for inter-faculty exchange into Computer Science - Major Software Engineering for Fall 2015, but I am doing poorly in my first semester, so my GPA is low (didn't get all grades back but probably below 3 with the fail). I am considering dropping ECSE200 and MATH270 because many people say they are very difficult courses and I am trying to take courses to boost my GPA above 3.0. Five courses was also a lot for me to handle, so I want to take only four core courses, or five courses including an elective I can do well in. Is this a wise course of action?

In the end, I wish to be enrolled in: MATH263, COMP250, ECSE221, and COMP206 (and possibly an easy elective like a classical music history class, the name escapes me atm). However, COMP206 is Open - Waitlist Full so can I argue my way into it like MATH263?

Is it technically possible to be enrolled in multiple classes with time conflicts? e.g. for MATH263 I will be using my notes, the textbook and my friends' notes since I already took the course, so I wouldn't mind if this class conflicted with another. I'd just go to the other class.

I am also enrolled in FACC100 for Engineering but, if I manage to switch into Computer Science, will it be useless since it is a 1 credit course? However, I also understand that I might not be admitted for inter-faculty exchange, and FACC100 must be taken in my 1st year of Engineering if I recall correctly.

Sorry again for all the questions. Thank you for your time!

EDIT: thank you for the prompt and insightful comments everyone. I can sleep a little better at night now",0

"Horrible first year and summer. Academic standing due to summer courses help please! In fall 2014 I got an F in Math 133 and a C+ in comp 202. I retook Math 133 in Winter 2015 and got a D, then again in summer and got an F.

So the bad part of my transcript is

Fall 2014
Math 133 F
COMP 202 C+

Winter 2015
MATH 141 D
MATH 133 D
COMP 250 F

Summer 2015 

MATH 133 F

So far my accademic standing was above 2.0 until the summer term. I will retake MATH 141 in July in summer. I really don know what to do I had a really bad start. Math 133 is hard. Math 141 I should have taken it more seriously.

When I took COMP 202 in fall I left the assignments to the last moment and did not understand the course that well. Then for comp 250 I had Robillard (see rate my prof) and we did group assignments. My partner was horrible, he told me I was dumb after we got a low grade on the first assignment and didn let me really collaborate on other assignments hence I did not get to learn.

My major is comp sci and its what I want to do. I find it really interesting.

What will happen if after doing math 141 again in summer my gpa drops bellow 2.0?

Luckily I did well in CHEM 110 and 120 (got As).

Also sometimes I feel really left out in the ""comp sci community"" as a female in this program. My GPA will always suck. If I do better after this will hiring companies be forgiving? Am I allowed to take MATH 133 again a 4th time?

I am entering U1 in Comp Eng and I have questions about my plan for my studies.

Then, I wonder what I should do with COMP 202. Apparently students with ""prior programming experience"", which I have, can replace it with another class. However, I have a feeling that it's in Java and I know next to nothing about it (mostly focused on Python and C/C++). Do you think I have a chance of not taking it?

"Schedule - PHYS/CS :o Hey fellow McGillians! Hope all's going well. I've kinda been lurking here for a while looking at what's up and info and different courses and whatnot, and thought I'd go ahead a post a concern I'm having.. :/

So, I'm entering McGill this Fall as a U1 with advanced standing (still not sure what this actually means) because I have 24+ AP credits leaving high school, but still need to complete U0 requirements.. Registration for courses opens tomorrow and so I was hoping I can run a few questions by y'all (yeah, going from Texas ----&gt; Montreal) since y'all know what's up and have walked the walk before. I'm planning to double major in Physics and Computer Science, and I kind of drafted a schedule thing for the terms and I'm hoping you knowledgeable people can help!

Fall 2015:
CHEM 110, BIOL 111, MATH 133, PHYS 230, PHYS 257

OK so about the last two... I got a 5 on the AP Physics B exam in high school, and so I'm receiving credit for PHYS 101 and 102. Just a few days ago, as I was looking over my pre-preliminary schedule, I found that PHYS 131 and 142, which I was pretty excited to take because I've heard it's an awesome class for gaining a basis in the field, has a restriction stating 'Not open to students taking or having taken PHYS 101, CEGEP objective 00UR or equivalent.' Since I have credit for 101 and 102 from Physics B, I guess I wouldn't be able to take them and get them to actually count in my grades. :(

For my Winter term:
CHEM 120, MATH 141, MATH 222, PHYS 258, COMP 250

Feeling kind of iffy about the two math classes, taking Calculus 2 (MATH 141) and Calculus 3 (MATH 222) at the same time. Can anyone provide feedback on your experience in these classes and if you believe this is actually possible? I've contacted advisers and stuff about the Physics courses and stuff, and they said stuff along the lines of 'it'll be addressed after you complete the Course Approval form,' which, from what I understand, won't be looked over until after registration?

I hope you guys can provide some insight into whether this courseload is even feasible and if I'd get like 15 ulcers by this time next year. Thanks! You guys the real MVPs.",0

"Advice on Courses Hi! I'm a new U1 student and I have a few questions about classes I want to take. 

I was admitted to the faculty of arts, but I'm going to try to transfer into sciences, specifically microbiology and immunology. I need to take psyc 100 to transfer, but it overlaps with a mimm (microbiology) course for half an hour. Is it feasible to register for overlapping classes and then just watch the recordings of the lectures for psyc 100 on the day that I can't go? I found the syllabus for psyc and it seems like the only grades are the midterm and the final, but for anyone who's taken the class, are there any quizzes or other reasons I would need to go to class on the day it overlaps?

I'm not sure as to what math class I should take either. I took math SL in high school and struggled with it somewhat. I had a low B average in the class throughout the year, but I also didn't study my hardest for it. I was thinking of taking math 139 because I wasn't sure that I had enough calculus for 140. However, 140 gives me more flexibility with my schedule and I'm worried that 139 will be full by the time I can register. As I'm in the faculty of arts, some classes are restricted for registration until the end of June.

Will I be ok taking biol 200 without taking chem 212 at the same time? 

Finally, is there anyone who has successfully transferred from arts to science? Any insight would be much appreciated!

"Which courses do you recommend for the first term in CS? Hi everyone,

Next fall, I'll begin my first term as a major in CS (U1). I feel a little bit lost. I don't know what courses I should take. I'm planning on studying comp 202 by myself this summer (I found the course material online). I'm registered in math 222, 223 and I really want to have math 240, but even the waitlist is full. I'm also registered in comp 250 and 206. Is this a good plan? And should I wait for math 240? I mean, do I have a chance to enter it if even the waitlist is full and nothing seems to be moving?

So, what do you recommend?

I have five elective slots this upcoming academic year and, since I've already taken one of the required classes, I'm seriously considering completing a SSOM minor. I haven't seen a single post about it on this sub, so I'd love to hear more about it!


Is anyone currently in the program or has taken it before and would like to share their thoughts? What were your favorite classes/which classes or profs should I avoid? 


Also, do you think it's smart of me to try and complete it all within a year? In other words, would 5 SSOM classes be too much to handle?

"COMP 202 for science freshman year (prerequisite question) Hello. I am a new Science student starting this September. I am considering whether I should take COMP 202 on the winter term of my first year. This course is one of the approved freshman science courses; however, on the course description (http://www.mcgill.ca/study/2015-2016/courses/COMP-202), it has a prerequisite of ""a CEGEP level mathematics course."" I didn't take any CEGEP or AP-level math course in high school, but I will be taking two math courses in the Fall term. 
My questions: 


1. Since I'm trying to take COMP 202 in the winter term, do you think that my Fall term math courses can qualify as prerequisites for this course? 

2. If so, does this mean that I must add this course AFTER I have passed the Fall math courses? Or can I register in them now? (I haven't actually tried adding it in Minerva, because I wanted to make sure that it's OK for me to take this course) 

3. As a general rule of thumb, if Minerva allows me to add a course, then is it safe to assume that there isn't any problem with me registering in that course, despite the course descriptions? On the registration page, there is a statement something in the line of: ""Minerva doesn't always prevent you from enrolling in courses that you don't have the prerequisites to; it is your own responsibility to look it up,"" but I'm not sure if this means that it's against university regulations to actually do so, or if it's just a general warning saying that you might be in over your head in terms of the course material if you enroll without a prerequisite. I did a brief search and found that COMP 202 isn't very math-intensive, so I'm not really worried about the latter; I'm just wondering if they will LET me take this course in my first year.

I suck at history and that seems to be the entire class. I also think I screwed up my first assignment. I am considering switching to ECON 205 (Political Economy) with Thomas Velk, but I have no econ experience. I heard he's pretty easy though. My other option is PSYC 215 (Social Psychology) with Mark Baldwin, and again I have no psychology experience. I heard Baldwin is a great teacher but the course might be hard.

"Want to ascend to Honours EE (from Comp Eng). Take COMP 250 or not? I'm a U1 Comp Eng student and would like to enter Honours EE in U2 (for some reason we can only enter this program in U2 while every other faculty has directly application to Honours, but whatever).

I was told at the information session at the beginning of F15 semester that even if you want to go to Honours EE (from EE, Comp Eng or Soft Eng) that you had to follow your current program curriculum. So I registered for COMP 250 in W16... but recently, looking at the program requirements for Honours EE there's no COMP 250 anywhere. So if I take it, are they just going to tell me ""tough luck, you wasted a course, now stay for an 8th semester or suffer an 18 credit semester"" or what?

The only course I can replace it with, currently, is FACC 300. OOH I'm much more interested in taking COMP 250 as I found 202 completely and utterly trivial, and I like computer science. FACC 300 feels like something I should wait until U2 to take. But OTOH, I might be wasting 3 credits by taking COMP 250 (if it's in fact not required for Honours EE) and FACC 300 gives a better schedule... So what do I do?

TL;DR: Take COMP 250 (more enjoyable) or FACC 300 (better schedule)? What happens if I take COMP 250 required by Comp Eng but not Honours EE?

~~Also when can we register for courses for W16?~~ Turns out you can do it now, just added FACC 300 and waiting to see which one I drop

Will I be at a disadvantage compared with other students (like those who lived in Molson)? Are there any past students on this sub who can help me navigate the applied stuff?

"Question for Computer Science/Software Engineering (Bsc.) people from a U0 student I'm a U0 Science student who intends to major in either CS or SE (the Faculty of Science one). This is the second term for my U0 year - my question is, did you ever need Chem 120 (General Chemistry 2) as a prerequisite for any of your courses? My own research and common sense (obviously) seems to suggest no, but I saw it listed as a required course for the B.Eng Software Engineering program so I just wanted to be extra careful. 

Also, is it possible to do well in Math 223 (Linear Algebra) without having taken Math 141 (Calculus 2)? It doesn't seem to be listed exclusively as a prerequisite, but I'm aware that linear algebra often has a lot to do with calculus, so I just wanted to know if I have enough background to take this course this term. I took Math 133 (the introductory linear algebra) and Math 140 (Calc 1) in my Fall term, and will be taking Math 141 this term.

"What's the difference between Comp 202 and Comp 208 Hello,
I would like to ask this question as I mentioned in the title because one of my two friends kept telling me these two courses are very similar. The course description of comp 208 states that "" Introduction to computer systems. Concepts and structures for high level programming. Elements of structured programming using FORTRAN 90 and C. Numerical algorithms such as root finding, numerical integration and differential equations. Non-numerical algorithms for sorting and searching."" 
Does it mean the programming languages used in Comp 208 are FORTRAN 90 and C? Is Java also going to be taught? I probably will take Comp 208 in the fall. I have never completed any programming courses before. I tried to take Comp 202 in the beginning of this semester just to see whether I would like it or not so I can decide if I can take a CS minor. I ended up dropping it before the withdrawal deadline because I found coding was not my thing. Therefore, I really want to know the major difference between these two courses. Any ideas?

"McGill's equivalent Computer science class Hello, I attend the University of Toronto and I want to return to Montreal for the summer. Problem is I have to take a summer course.

So my question is what class is the most similar?  

A breif description copied and pasted from the CSC165 website:
This course introduces the students to abstraction and rigour. Informal introduction to logical notation and reasoning. Understanding, using and developing precise expressions of mathematical ideas, including definitions and theorems. Structuring proofs to improve presentation and comprehension. General problem-solving techniques. Running time analysis of iterative programs. Formal definition of Big-O. Diagonalization, the Halting Problem, and some reductions. Unified approaches to programming and theoretical problems.

"Need advice on course load (U1 pharmacology) I'll be going into U1 in pharmacology this fall and I'd like some advice on my courseload.

I'll be taking BIOL 200, PHGY 209, PHGY 212, CHEM 222, PHAR 200. I need 3 more credits (I want to take 15 credits/semester) so I was thinking about taking CHEM 203. 
Would that make my workload too heavy, especially considering it's my first semester? I heard CHEM 203 was easy but it does seem like a lot of classes. Would it be manageable? Has anyone taken a similar course load and how did it go? I would appreciate any advice/past experiences! 

As an alternative to CHEM 203 I'm considering CHEM 199 (a seminar class) or World of Chem (drugs). Opinions on those &amp; how they compare to CHEM 203?

"Two required Econ courses conflict? 208/230 Econ academic advising is closed for the summer so this is really my last resort. Thanks for even opening this thread!

I'll keep it simple. U1 student. I'm doing a B.A. with Econ &amp; Math major concentrations.

One my required econ courses is Microeconomic theory (230).

As I was looking at the 300-level courses that I will have to take next year, I notice that they all require Micro/Macro Analysis&amp;Application (208 - 209), so obviously I register for it.

Minerva has let me register for 208; however, it states in the course info, on Minerva as well as all over the McGill website:
&gt;Restriction: Not open to students who have taken or are taking ECON 230 or ECON 250

So what am I missing here? Microecon theory is a required course for my major, whereas this class is required for any 300-level class that I will eventually have to take. I cannot do 208-209 in the first year because if I wait for U2 to start microecon theory it's impossible to graduate on time. 

I've been trying to understand this for hours but I think I'm just missing something. Any insight would be greatly appreciated!



TL;DR not allowed to take two courses, even though both are de facto required for my major.

"BIOL 200 professors: Bureau+Roy or Zetka+Hastings So I'm taking BIOL 200 this fall and I noticed that all the information available on this subreddit talks about somebody named Faggotto, who is not teaching BIOL 200 this semester. 

The two choices that I have are: 
[Thomas Bureau+Richard Roy] in the morning 
OR 
[Monique Zetka+Kenneth Hastings] in the afternoon.

Is there a significant difference in the difficulty of the professors? I was leaning towards picking the afternoon course, since I'm not really a morning person, but if the morning lecture will be easier I'll change my courses around.

"Math 140/141 or 150/151, and Major vs Honours math So I originally registered in Math 140/141/133 because I thought that that's all I needed to do a math. However, when I was looking on the website it said to strongly consider taking 150/151 if going into Honours Mathematics.

So I switched into 150/151. Now, as someone who has no idea what they want to do in school or life, I was wondering whether there was any point in doing this. Let's say I wanted to do a math major or honours econ or something like that. What benefit do I gain from taking 150/151? I want to be able to enjoy my life first year, and I'm being told it's probably the hardest two courses I could take in first year, so I'm starting to fear that they'll ruin my life and my GPA.

On the other hand, some friends I went to school with told me math 140/141 are basically all review and 140 was the easiest course they took in first year. For background I did IB SL Mathematics. 

So here's my question: Would I be shooting myself in the foot taking 150/151? What is the difference between honours Math and major math, and does 140/141 or 150/151 make a difference? Should I take 140/141 and take 222 in second year or does it really help a lot to take 150/151?",0

Is this course only easy for those with a background in music? Will I be able to get through the course and get the A that I was hoping for, and do you have any advice on how I should go about doing this?

How are the exams structured? Will there be music played and I will have to determine the texture/form/etc. of a song? Or will I just need to associate a word with it's definition? Because I have no problem memorizing definitions, but actually applying the definitions is quite challenging...

2. If you only had to take one of these classes, which would you take? Why? Which one teaches more skills/is more fun/is easier?

Basically: I have an intense last school year coming up and I'm looking for 2 relatively easy Econ courses to tie up my Econ minor (ideally one in the Fall and one in the Winter). For the record, I've already taken Econ 337/338 so that's not an option and my only other background is 208/209. 

Currently, I'm leaning towards Econ 334 in the Fall with William Watson (essay-style exams worry me a little here as I've not had to write essays in any classes thus far) and Econ 219 in the Winter with Chris Ragan. Any thoughts?

I'd planned to take some Velk courses but, if what I hear is correct, the word is that those are far from easy in recent semesters (and it's not obvious  what he's teaching next year actually)....",0
"ECSE - Thoughts on Prof. Shane McIntosh Anyone have experience with / thoughts on Professor Shane McIntosh? 

I'm thinking of taking ECSE 429 with him next semester but, even taking rateMyProfessor with a grain of salt, his abysmal reviews are more than a little disconcerting...

At a glance, it seems like the rateMyProf'ers are mostly upset with him for a particular semester of ECSE 321 (ISE) during which the project was considered pretty overwhelming...

Beyond that though, I haven't heard much - except that he seemed pretty chill when I met him in person once. Looking for folks with strong thoughts and/or counter-arguments to the rateMyProf'ers?",0

One thing that worries me is whether the class is similar to ECSE 322 (Computer Engineering) or not. Right now I am taking 322 which I was very excited about, but it is one of the worst classes I took due to the ancient and irrelevant technology discussed in the course, as well as amount of material covered (never feel like I learned enough about any topic). Is this class similar in terms of these aspects? 

Also, how is the amount of work/difficulty of this class? I looked at syllabus from previous years and there seems to be multiple assignments, 2 midterms, a final and a project. This seems a bit much and this course will be part of 17-credit semester.

I also did a few economy courses (208, 209) which might have some relevance.

I've registered for COMP273, COMP206, MATH323 and MATH223 next fall. I want to know if taking these four in a single semester would be doable. Also Vybihal's teaching both 206 and 273 and I havent heard alot of good things about him. I'd appreciate any advise regarding these and Im open to any other suggested 300-level comp courses. 
Thanks in advance! ",0

"COMP 202 elective for someone who hasn't done math in 6 years? I know 202 is a pretty popular class that's asked about in here, but I couldn't find any recent questions about this so hope it's ok to post.  

I'm in arts, majoring in linguistics so I have done logic (PHIL 210), as well as semantics (LING 360) which also exercises logical analysis skills. I have some experience in coding too--years of CSS/HTML even tho it's been a while, I also learned some basic Java/Javascript on my own through online resources such as code academy. (I know HTML is not the same at all but I figure all those years of ""thinking in code-speak"" and troubleshooting code may be helpful.) 

My issue is I haven't done math since the summer before grade 11, like 6 years ago. TBH I can't even tell you the difference between algebra and calculus  that's how dire my math skillz are. Can I still take COMP 202 and hope to do well? I have an interest in programming and am considering doing grad school for computational ling or maybe a certification course in programming after. ",0

"Most doable honours MATH/PHYS courses? Hi guys, I just found out that Honours Quantitative Bio requires 6 of the required MATH/PHYS credits to be at the Honours level. I'm wondering if anyone could let me know in which, out of the following pairs of courses, is the honours equivalent most doable as compared to the regular!

(Applied Linear Algebra) MATH 223 / 247
(ODEs) MATH 315 / 325
(Probability) MATH 323 / 356
(Statistics) MATH 324 / 357
(Mechanics) PHYS 230 / 251
(Thermo) PHYS 232 / 253

A bit more info:
I'm entering U1 so I'm not sure whether I will make it into Honours (3.5 cutoff), but given that nearly all of the courses with the honours option are U1 courses for me (all except ODEs and Statistics), I'm wondering how I'm supposed to plan this out ahead of time. There is always the option of doing a MATH at 500 level which will also count towards this requirement, but that's hopefully a last resort...
I'm also wondering about how the Honours cutoff works - do you have to maintain a 3.5 throughout in order to stay in Honours, or just make it above the cutoff going into U2, for example? If it's the latter I might delay taking honours courses until U2..
If anyone is wondering, I am interested in Honours mainly for the thesis/research courses, not for advanced courses like these :/ please let me know if I'm thinking about it in the wrong way, though!
Anyways I must sound really confused, so if anyone has any advice for QB or Science Honours in general please hit me up!! Thanks!",0

"The trickery of MATH 133... So I will be going into U1 this September... Declared Comp Sci major. Only one problem.... I got a D in MATH 133. Now, I don't know the specifics, as my advisor didn't either. I figured i'd ask on here before I see a program advisor. I am actually quite fond of math, I did well in MATH 140/141. MATH 133 was a blunder, and I am wondering if I have to retake it....

In order to take MATH 222 (Calc 3), the internet tells me that I simply need credit for MATH 133. 

http://www.mcgill.ca/study/2017-2018/faculties/arts/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-arts-ba-major-concentration-computer-science

Need advice from Economics Majors (230 and 330 at the same time?) [deleted],0
"Need advice from Comp and Math people I've recently changed my Major to Software Eng and Math, and have been trying to figure out the best plan for the coming Fall and Winter semesters.

So I've been running around, seeing advisors, emailing advisors, and generally just stressing out.

My advisor says its safe for me to skip taking Comp 202, as I've been studying Java programming myself all summer. 
I've already taken Math 222, 133, and got excemption from 140 and 141. 

Outside of that I have no credits towards my major or minor. 
Am I locked to taking COMP 250 and then 4 maths for my first semester? I can't take COMP206 without 250, and can't take COMP 273 without 206. 

Assuming that I am stuck doing that, would it be a trainwreck if I took COMP250 , MATH 323, MATH 240, MATH 315, and MATH 223 all at the same time? I'd say I'm averagely skilled at math but have generally stayed above the curve through high work ethic. 

** I think its also worth mentioning that since I've changed majors  I have basically no electives, and if I have any I'd prefer to take them in my later years as 400-500 level comp classes**

**EDIT I'm also open to taking summer classes to relieve the heavy math semester, but I have no idea how to know which courses are offered in the summer**

"CS students : you should consider taking COMP 598 If you are a U2/U3 student in Computer Science and you have an interest for Biology, you should look into COMP 598 this Fall. It's a new course that is not given every year and complements COMP 462/561. There is no need for a Biology background, the only course you need is COMP 462, and it can be taken at the same time.

The course load is quite advantageous as most of the grade comes from assignments, presentations (very informal) and a project, and there is no midterm. The average last year was an A- and I think most students enjoyed the class because it provides knowledge that you can't really get anywhere else. it will also help you brush up your dynamic and object-oriented programming while applying it to new kinds of data in a pretty relaxed course.

If you have not yet taken COMP 462, I do recommend the combination of 561/598 which gives you 7 credits for two courses that are more relaxed than average for a CS class (both have A- averages) as they are mostly assignment and project based (everything in Python), are useful as CS classes as they teach how to apply useful algorithms and models, probability and dynamic programming, but also give you a perspective on multidisciplinary computer science, and are taught by awesome lecturers. They also let you combine projects for both classes and write one combined report, which is pretty cool !

**Details :**

*Time*: Tuesday/Thursday 11:35 AM - 12:55 PM 
*Location*: Rutherford Physics Building 114 
*Instructor*: Jerome Waldispuhl (jeromew@cs.mcgill.ca) 
*URL*: http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jeromew/comp598.html 

**Syllabus:** 
This class will introduce fundamental concepts and techniques in computational structural biology and computational system biology. Computational structural biology aims to model and predict the structure of bio-molecules (e.g., proteins, DNA, RNA), and computational system biology provides methods to model and study biological systems. These fields of study has a broad impact on the understanding of gene regulation processes and biological system mechanisms. It also open new research directions in synthetic biology such as the design of new bio-molecular devices and the re-engineering of biological functions. 
We will cover the theory and practice of computational techniques developed in these research areas. Each session will feature a description of the methods and algorithms, and will be completed by a practical session in which we will describe how to use state-of-the-art software. 

**Note:** This class extends the material covered in COMP462/561 (i.e. Computational Biology Methods and Research). Students can take the 2 courses (COMP462/561 &amp; COMP598) concurrently during the Fall 2017 session.",0
"Computational Perception CS Students: What are your opinions on Comp 546? I've never heard much about it compared to the other 400/500 levels, and I've never had Dr. Langer as a professor. I was wondering if I could get some insight on it, since it fits into my schedule very well.

"What to do if classes are full? Hello everyone!

I am planning to attend McGill this fall but it seems like I am encountering a few problems. I am hoping to major in CS but it seems like a lot of the classes are already full. I have managed to get into COMP 202, MATH 140, COMP 206, MATH 133 and MATH 240 for the first semester. But it seems like COMP 202 is a prerequisite for COMP 206 so I can't take them simultaneously. But the problem is that COMP 206 is full for the second semester. COMP 250 is also full for both semesters as well and it seems to serve as a prerequisite for the other required CS courses.

As for the second semester, I have gotten into MATH 141 and COMP 273 and that's it for now. MATH 223 (Linear algebra) is also full......

"Question to all Computer Science students Hello!

I am a first year U1 student that has just started at McGill. I am planning on a CS major and Math minor. I came in without having received credit for COMP 202, MATH 140 AND 141. With this in mind, the classes I selected for the first semester were COMP 202, MATH 133, MATH 140, MATH 240 AND MATH 318. The first 4 I have listed I know I need to take so they are not the worry. My worry is for MATH 318. The only reason I chose it was because it had no prerequisites and I needed to choose a fifth class to reach 15 credits (ideally). Unfortunately, the material that has been covered so far has been slightly confusing and everyone in my class seems to be older than me. The professor also has a rating of 1.4/5 on ratemyprof and most of the reviews said that they ended up with a W in the course. Honestly, I'd much rather make a decision now than take a W later. Also, rather than being a required course, it is a complementary course. I have to take two of the classes out of MATH 318, MATH 323 AND MATH 324. I'd much rather take 323 and 324 to be honest as they actually cover things that sound interesting like probability and statistics.

So my question is, what was your schedule in your first semester in the first year as a CS major? And also, if I were to drop MATH 318, what instead could I replace it with (I don't meet the requirements for any of the other required courses yet). Would I take an elective? Could I take a class to fulfill my math minor requirements? How easy is it to catch up in a new class after missing the first 2 weeks? How would taking only 12 credits this semester be viewed (I already have 30 transfer credits because of IB and I'm planning to graduate in 4 years rather than 3)?

Any help would be highly appreciated!

"Math 235 Fall 2017 MATH 235 with Dani Wise this semester doesn't seem to bear any resemblance to the MATH 235 that was taught any other semester. I know he's a group theorist but it seems like that's all we've done all semester. Goren's 235 notes seem to barely cover groups at all, and none of the previous midterms even touched groups but instead focused mostly number theory. Does this much variation happen often? What was MATH 235 like for you?

"COMP 250 Feedback Hey guys,

We're trying to set up COMP 250 for the Winter semester and we'd like to get some feedback from people who took the course last Fall (Langer) or Winter (Blanchette), or before. You can comment down here or send me a PM, both a fine. Throwaways are welcome (if you hated everything please let me know).

More specifically, I'd like to hear what you think about the following:

* How was your discussion board experience ? Would you have used the discussion board if it was not on MyCourses ? 
* How was your facebook group experience ? Was that something useful, do you think that is something the prof should monitor ?
* If you had MyCourses quizzes, was that something you thought was okay, or do you have strong feelings about having a written midterm ?
* How were office hours ? Did you make use of them at all ? Were the TAs helpful ?
* How were tutorials ? Did you make use of them at all ? Where they helpful ?

Thank you very much, any comment at all is helpful.

Additionally, if you have taken **251** with Jerome last Winter, any comment on what you thought went well and what you thought went very poorly with this course is welcome and could be useful to us. Thanks !",0

"U1 Math winter term workload I'm taking honours analysis/algebra/cal3/comp in the first semester, the workload is pretty reasonable and material is not particularly hard. However this is partly due to the fact the first 2~3 weeks of analysis/algebra are introductory material to set and proof and they are not even tested. Particularly for analysis, the exam actually only covers materials from week 7-13 since the previous chapters are simply cornerstones for later chapters which are not important in themselves (like Sup/Inf, real number, point-set topology). The exam for 254 is also quite memorization based.

This is clearly not the case for Honours algebra 2/analysis 2. I wonder how rapidly will the workload and difficulty of material changes in the next semester? (I also take honours ODE along, which is likely harder than cal3 and lack of familiarity).",0

"CS Major Course Selection Advice I will be entering my 3rd year as a CS major next year and am facing somewhat of a dilemma.

So it says on the [page](http://www.mcgill.ca/study/2017-2018/faculties/science/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-science-bsc-major-computer-science) that we should take two of COMP 330, 350 and 360. I wanted to know what anyone here would suggest for this. I was leaning towards 360 for sure because it is based on algorithms and that is definitely something I should focus on. But how about between 330 and 350. Does anyone have any input on either of these two courses and which one would be better? Or should I take 330 and 350 but not 360?

And for the MATH requirements of 3-9 credits. I was thinking that I would take all 9 including both of MATH 323 and 340 (as at least one of them was required so why not take both) and then either MATH 318 OR 324. Does anyone have any input on which of 318 or 324 would be more preferable? I was leaning towards 324 to complement 323 but I'm honestly not sure. Or should I only take 3 or 6 credits and take an additional COMP course instead?

"English course (ENGL297) versus Psychology (PSYC337) course at McGill So I'm still debating between ENGL297 with Prof Banderjee and PSYC337 with Prof Weinberg.

I've never taken an English class at McGill before. I'm trying to transfer into life science this semester so my purpose is to 1. focus on doing well in BIOL112 and CHEM120 and as a result 2. getting a higher gpa than what I have now.

Which course would be a better choice so I can focus on doing well in biol112 and chem120 (my prerequisites) and as a result, getting a high gpa? considering:
ENGLISH - con: I don't know how the ENGL297 course is. Ratemyprof's review on the prof is good in general but to be honest learning about postcolonial topics doesn't really excite me that much, but I would do it if it helps save time to focus on my science courses. The idea is that I would hope to get an A in this course or else it's really pointless because I have no more electives anyways and it doesn't count for B.Sc psychology anyways.
=&gt; pro: no final exam, better scheduling, MAY help me save time for my other courses 
=&gt; neutral: It also is a med requirement ONLY for Cornell University (I already have IB English credits that satisfy it for every other university I am interested in).

PSYCHOPATHOLOGY - con: Bad scheduling, bad ratemyprof review on the prof. I have to run from leacock to my chem lab right after and I may risk being late. Also, my chem midterm and psychopathology midterm would be on the same day which is just really inconvenient. Also, there's a final exam. (different time)

**COMP** 

Code|Title| Comments
:--|:--|:--                       
**COMP 202** | Intro Comp | Teaches a lot of new concepts if this is your first introduction to CS. However, it is a very fun and rewarding  class. Even if this course is not part of your major, I would recommend taking it as an elective to give programming a try. I had Anil Ada, who I don't believe is a McGill lecturer any longer.
**COMP 206** | Intro to Software | Didn't particularly enjoy this class and ended up skipping quite a bit. Learning the UNIX environment was quite useful though. We also covered C, Python, Perl, HTML &amp; CGI, but each one somewhat superficially. I had Vybihal for this class who is a good prof and is a big proponent of recorded lectures.
**COMP 250** | Intro to CS | This class felt like 202 Extended, and I enjoyed it a lot. It was somewhat abstract, so I'd recommend really focusing on the assignments to develop intuition. You learn your basic data structures (in Java) like arrays, stacks, binary trees, etc. This class is useful if you intend to interview for internship positions, where the coding questions will build off this knowledge. 
**COMP 251** | Data Structures | This class felt like 250 Extended. If you took 250, you probably have to take this class anyways.  Again, looking at data structures, but with more depth. Useful for tech interviews as it teaches you dynamic programming, graph algorithms, red-black trees, etc. Had Jerome Waldispuhl who was great at teaching the concepts clearly.
**COMP 273** | Intro to Computer Systems | This seems to be a pretty polarizing course. Very interesting to learn how the low-level operates even if it's not your primary interest. This class seemed to be divided into Assembly, which I didn't really care too much for, and microcircuit design, which was extremely fun. Basically, we learned to create CPU, RAM, storage, etc. in terms of circuits. I found myself zoning out a lot during the lectures, but when playing around with Logisim and Assembly at home, things just made way more sense. Took this lass with Vybihal again.
**COMP 302** | Programming Paradigms | Had to use SML/NJ as a language, so I wasn't too thrilled about that, but I've heard things have modernized since then. My first look into functional programming which was very different to everything I had seen so far. Very fun and useful concepts in this (albeit quite confusing). However, it can definitely get overwhelming and you'll ask yourself why does anyone thinks like this? Wasn't too time consuming of a course as assignments were relatively easy. Had Friedman as a lecturer.
**COMP 303** | Software Development | Thought I would enjoy this class, but did not at all. Like you would learn all these design patterns (like Flyweight, Observer, etc.) that would make sense on their own, but didn't really translate to useful tools when I code. I feel like maybe it was my own fault for not getting the picture. It definitely did feel like the prof was just too smart for me to understand, and all I was left with was a patchwork of loosely connected knowledge. Definitely a class that I kept zoning out of. 
**COMP 330** | Theory of Computation | I had Prakash for this course which definitely made it a great experience. Prakash is a blessing. Very funky class that doesn't involve any coding or traditional CS. The assignments were quite time-consuming and difficult, but the midterm/final were difficult but fair. The knowledge I gained from this class seems very domain specific, like if you wanted to write your own programming language for example. Still a fun and worthwhile class. 
**COMP 350** | Numerical Computing | This class was all about how computers do their calculations at the low level - think rounding errors, solving linear equations, polynomial interpolation etc. It can be somewhat dry, but what you learn is lowkey useful. Assignments were very fair, midterm and final as well. The prof (Xiao-Wen Chang) said that if you go to class and do the assignments, you'd do well in his course, and that held true. Honestly felt more like a math class than a CS class (which makes sense, since it's somewhat equivalent to MATH 317). 
**COMP 360** | Algorithm Design | Most people seem to not like this class, but I found it interesting with Hatami. I don't know when I'll use the knowledge from this course in the real world though, but it's there, in the back of my head, slowly fading away... The Big-O, and complexity classes stuff was not too fun, but the network fow, dynamic programming, and linear programming were really interesting. There was also a part on PTAS, which I didn't even pretend to understand, but it wasn't tested. 🙏🙏🙏
**COMP 424** | Artificial Intelligence | I had Joelle for this class, who was a great prof. The assignments and evaluations were hard but the content was very interesting and I had no trouble paying attention in class when Joelle taugh it. The grading scheme at the time was also the best grading scheme I have come across at McGill. Starts easy, but gets pretty challenging all at once after the midterm, so be careful. 
**COMP 462** | Computational Biology | Despite the name, this class probably had the most programming involved out of most of my CS classes. You don't really need any prior bio knowledge to go into this class, so I feel many CS students overlook this great class. You learn to solve many real-life problems in the programming language of your choice. Open book exams and assignments that are worth a lot made this class a very stress free experience. Would definitely recommend, especially with Blanchette.

* *Note*: I didn't really use the textbook for any COMP class, so I can't make comment on them.

&amp;nbsp;

**MATH** 
                
Code|Title| Comments
:--|:--|:-- 
**MATH 133** | Linear Algebra | Definitely a very hard freshman course. Starts off with matrices and linear equations, and everything is super simple like using your fingers to multiply matrices together, and then all of sudden eigenvalues and eigenvectors appear out of nowhere and you're lost. Don't let the low course code fool you, keep on top of your work for this class and use the textbook to do problems when you can. 
**MATH 140** | Calculus 1 | You probably have to take this class if you're reading this. Make sure you understand Riemann sums intuitively and just practice lots of problems and you should be good. This was taught by Axel H3 Hundemer, so that definitely made things easier. 
**MATH 141** | Calculus 2 | Cal 1 with integration. This is another math class where practicing a large volume of problems is very important. Definitely harder than Cal 1, and many of the students in Cal1+2 have taken some form of calculus in high school, so if you haven't, I would recommend reading the textbook after class to make sure you keep along. Oh yeah, the textbook is good.
**MATH 222** | Calculus 3 | The single worst experience of my McGill career.
**MATH 223** | Linear Algebra 2 | I didn't really go to this class at all, so I will refrain from making too many calls. Will make you realize how much you've forgotten from 133. However, people seem to do better in the Lin 2 than Lin 1, as they seem to be more prepared this time. The textbook for this class was very useful for me. If it's still the Schaum's Outlines one, I would go get it (it's also like 18 bucks). 
**MATH 235** | Algebra 1 | How many different necklaces can you make with 5 rubies and 5 diamonds? Like fucking billions apparently. This class seemed to appeal to more pure mathy students, of which I do not belong. It did not really interest me, but if you memorize certain theorems and the bigger example problems, you can do well. 
**MATH 242** | Analysis 1 | Again, it's the boi Axel Hundemer showing us how it's done. This class is for if you didn't trust what they taught you in calculus. The content can be somewhat abstract, but Axel will show you the way. Assignments didn't take too much time, but there are a lot of them, and you sometimes do worse than you expected for some reason. I would recommend studying for this class with a partner, and taking turns explaining to each other what is going on, until your definitions eventually match. 
**MATH 314** | Advanced Calculus | Went *ok*. This felt like it would be more useful if I was in engineering. You learn stuff like surface and line integrals, implicit functions and Jacobians. Remember Stokes, Gauss, and Green? You learn their theorems too. It is a very structured course, with distinct blocks that you can learn and practice. Feels like you make progress when you study. Still pretty hard though. 
**MATH 323** | Probability | From what I've heard, this course may depend heavily on your professor. I had Anderson and I really enjoyed this class. You might have to memorize distributions and their expected values, which is the not-so-fun part. But I feel like what you learn from this class is very useful, and it helps to think of each distribution in terms of simple examples. Textbook is decent, but not critical. Would recommend.
**MATH 324** | Statistics | Didn't really attend this class, and really should have. The content from that class makes sense to me now, in retrospect, after having to learn it after the fact. In that sense, this is class that can seem really hard or really easy depending on whether you took the time to truly go through the material. I would like to take this class again. Took it with Steele who is actually a really great prof with helpful notes.
**MATH 340** | Discrete Structures 2 | This class was divided into 3 very distinct sections, which made it much easier to study for: Graph Theory (fun), Discrete Probability (alright), Enumeration (alright). These topics really don't overlap at all. Otherwise, the content was easy enough to digest, except that one random section on the Balls in Bin problem. Had Norin as a prof, who is extremely smart, but it felt like he was maybe a little bit too smart for us.
**MATH 410** | Majors Project | Definitely recommend if you are looking into going to grad school. Independent study with a prof on a topic that you and your prof decide. It is largely self-motivated, so take that into account. Try to keep working on it over the course of the semester if you can.
**MATH 423** | Regression | This course was taught by David Stephens, who is my favourite prof at McGill, so this review could be biased. This was a really good course that taught the fundamentals of regression, and had several real-world examples in R. The prof always sends extra handouts/practice problems to help you out for assignments/midterms/finals, so if you read through them thoroughly, everything should be swell. 
**MATH 447** | Stochastic Processes | One of the only classes which I enjoyed yet still did poorly in. David Wolfson was great, content was interesting, I didn't do well. I might have been studying wrong, so be careful I guess? The textbook does not help at all, that's for sure, I felt like it was way too advanced for the notes, thus wasting your time. Still glad I took the course though.
**MATH 524** | Non-parametric Statistics | Very cool stats class, and Genest is a great teacher. This is a very small class (~10 people), but everyone seemed to do well. The assignments were tough and time consuming but the professor adequately prepared you for the midterm and final such that everyone did well. 
**MATH 545** | Time Series | This was potentially one of my most useful classes at McGill. Definitely not easy, and there will probably not be any curve. Taught by Stephens again, so you know you he'll keep you well prepared. He hosts weekly optional tutorials if you feel like you're falling behind. This is a time consuming class for sure, with a heavy final, but I would still recommend it.

* *Note*: Many of the math classes have optional midterms with highly weighted finals (80%+). Write the midterm like it was a real one!

"U2 Math/CS Courses I'm looking around at the unoffical timetable link for next semester and trying to pick out courses for the 2018-2019 year.

It looks like Prakash is teaching COMP 330 which should be a blast

Xue Liu has pretty good reviews for COMP 310 and it seems like a neat class

On the math side I'm not sure what to take. I figure it's a good idea to take Honours Probability (MATH 356) since I haven't yet and it will open some AI/ML courses for the semester after, but how is this class? People seem to have very mixed feelings about it. Apparently Linan Chen is very difficult. Is this the case?

I'm taking Honours Algebra 2 (MATH251) and Honours Analysis 2 (MATH 255) and honestly preferring Analysis so far. It's probably harder but seems much more interesting. Algebra 1 (MATH 235) left a horrible taste in my mouth last semester because of how badly it was organized/taught so I feel like it's ""ruined"" algebra for me. If I don't have enough room for both Algebra 3 and Analysis 3, which would others who have taken these courses say are more interesting? Analysis seems neat but Algebra feels more applicable to CS, which what I'm ultimately planning to stick to for grad / employment. Does it get more interesting later, or just more difficult? What is the difficulty level of Hon. Algebra 3/4 and Hon. Analysis 3/4?

Also, I haven't taken Hon. Ad. Cal (MATH 248) yet, and next semester it conflicts with COMP 310 which I'm much more interested in. Is there any risk in pushing it off yet again and taking it my last semester? It doesn't look like it's an official prereq for anything other than graduating.

1. Honours Algebra/Analysis 3,4: I notice that Prof. Goren and Drury both have notes for the courses but from my past experience other profs may not adopt their notes.

2. Honours complex analysis: I notice that the famous textbook by Stein is used by many profs. But since it is the second book of a series of four, it assumes readers to know knowledge from the first book (Fourier Analysis) which is not taught here. I wonder whether profs generally follow this book closely or not.

3. Honours Prob/Stat: just can't find anything online about them.

4. Honours Advanced Calculus

5. Honours Set Theory or MATH 458 (Differential Geometry), not sure if the latter is good to be taken at U2 level.

"Best elective? (Chem 183, ATOC 185, PHYS 182) Hey all!

I know there are tonnes of these posts, but I have a few questions and I want everyones honest opinion about electives. So i am going into U1 after finishing my U0 year, and i am taking mimm. 

I have space for an elective but I am not sure what to take, I am interested in 3 classes: Chem 183, Phys 182, and ATOC 185. I am interested in all of them, but I am not sure which one would be the best. (I would prefer something on the easier side, because BIO 200 is going to be the death of me)

Chem 183:
I read on a previous syllabus that they dock marks for wrong answers, does this still apply? How would you go about dealing with that policy? Is it a lot of memorization? 

Phys 182
I have heard it has gotten significantly harder. I love the theory, and the ideas around it however, I am not the best at physics. Is it okay? Are there many calculation based questions or is it mostly theory? I survived 101 and 102 with an A, however i'm not sure about this class? 

ATOC 185
I have never written a term paper before, what is it about? Is the class a tonne of work, and possible memorization?? 

Overall, if you have taken one of these classes I would love your input! I have researched them all, and they all seem to cover interesting material! However, if you have any warnings about the class I would love to hear them! 

Thank you so much!",0

"Switching major to economics Hello, 

After giving it some thought throughout the semester I have come to the decision that I would like to major in economics. I am just a little bit concerned about my course selections. Apparently I can take both ECON 230 and ECON 330 simultaneously because I previously took ECON 208 and ECON 209 as electives. My schedule for the fall semester looks like this : ECON 227, ECON 230, ECON 330 and ECON 302. I will also be taking an elective as my fifth course. 

My question is mainly targeted towards current economics students. I am wondering if it is worth taking both ECON 230 and ECON 330 simultaneously or would that be overkill? I searched and I did find a previous reddit thread with a similar question, but I am hoping to get more opinions on the subject.

Thank you.

"Help for class schedule: already 5 math courses each term but need to insert comp 206 either semester U2 math student, my original schedule is like: 

Fall: MATH 366(Complex Analysis), MATH 356(Hon Probability), MATH 248(Advance Calc) Algebra 3 and Anal 3

Winter: COMP 252(Algorithm), MATH 357(Stat), Algebra 4, Anal 4, Diff Geometry.

I previously hate programming (but was aware that skill would be required at some point) so I only managed to have the minimum amount of comp courses. However, I am doing an internship right now and the experience do changed my mindset and make me want to gain more practical skill in this field. I wish to take more comp courses in U3 (doing a minor) so I need to finish comp 206 beforehand since it is a pre-req to most upper year courses.

When handling the intern job, I have learnt python, html, linux, C++ etc. which are parts of the course material. 

Now I need to decide at which semester that I should take it. Both are heavily loaded. I am leaning toward fall term, since three of them are analysis (real, complex, vector analysis) which should overlap a lot. But comp 252 and comp 206 are both cscourses, I think it might be helpful to take them together.  I'm also curious about the difficulty of Analysis/Algebra 3 vs. Analysis 4/Algebra 4.

For your record I'm doing ok in previous math/comp courses(most passed with A but do struggle a lot ).

I am an exchange student from Duke visiting McGill this semester, and I do not know a single person in all of Canada.

I promise I'm a hard worker!  


If you aren't in either of those two courses, I still would like to get to know you.  I'm interested in just about everything, and I am really looking forward to meeting new people here.

"Suggestion of a winter comp course? Hi, U2 math student here. I've completed comp 202, 206, 250 so far and want to do another one or two comp courses in the winter term (I originally planned to have comp 252 but it overlaps with analysis 4...). Going through the comp course webpage I found that a lot of courses' pre-reqs are just 206 + 250, and I don't really know how to select from them.

I want to have a course which is either very practical that improves one's programming skill or very math-oriented so that my background may help to get a good grade. I am also willing to choose a course if the prof teaching it is very inspiring.

The choices are:

1. COMP 273
2. COMP 302
3. COMP 303
4. COMP 350
5. COMP 251 (I don't really want to take it as only 252 contributes credits to my program of study. But the latter one is only taught in the winter. If I want to take 252, I need to wait till the last semester of U3 which might be a bad idea.)",0

"ECON 426 (Labour Econ) with Fabian Lange or ECON 423 (International Trade) with Julian Karaguesian? Hey guys, I have to pick one of these two courses for this semester and I’m really struggling between them. As much as I’ve heard good things about karaguesian, I went to one 3h lecture last Friday and I found him surprisingly boring and unclear. I feel like I’m missing something - what do people like about him? Is it that his exams are straightforward?

Here are my thoughts about both, based on two weeks of class. 

Labour econ: Lange is a far better lecturer but I’ve heard that his assignments and exams can be unclear/difficult. Can anyone confirm/deny?
Trade: 3h lecture once a week. The textbook for the course is exactly the same as for Econ 223, which is another trade course that I already took. So I’m already familiar with most of the material, but I have zero clue about assignments etc. His syllabus is literally one page! Nothing about the format of exams or what we’ll be tested on or anything like that. If anyone has taken it before I’d appreciate it if you could tell me whether he has additional readings that are tested, whether knowing lecture or textbook content is more important, etc. 

And lastly, if anyone’s taken both plz advise me on what to do. I am v lost. ",0

"Course Review Platform for McGill - Yourcourses.org Hi everyone!

We're a group of students who've been working on a course review platform for McGill! We've noticed that many students ask on reddit or fb 'how is this course', and we felt McGill needs an open course evaluation platform, so here we are! It's like ratemyprof except for classes, in hope that students' experience can help others better prep for their future courses.

We posted the pre-alpha version of the site several months back and now we're proudly releasing the site (beta-version)!! It's [***Yourcourses.org***](http://yourcourses.org). We currently have \~500 courses (mostly sciences for now, e.g. everything from ANAT, BIOC, BIOL, CHEM, COMP, PSYC, PHGY, NEUR, NSCI, PHAR, PATH, MIMM) and we're developing a auto-fetcher for all courses. Please feel free to try out the site, leave reviews for courses you've taken, and let us know if anything can be improved!

&amp;#x200B;

Few notes:

* There are a few things we'll improve in the coming days, e.g. addition of more courses, better graphical interface for course evaluation, some small bugs, speed issue (although it's already much faster now), etc. Hopefully it doesn't affect user experience too much!
* We don't employ Ads on the site, so if anyone wants to, we'd be glad if you tip us a couple of dollars to cover the cost
* Please let us know if you think anything can be improved!

Enjoy and don't forget to take study breaks!!

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE:

We're here to say thank you to everyone for your suggestions! We are listing the major suggestions and how we've gone about it so far. Thanks guys!!

* Search autocomplete - completely running now! Might take a second or 2, but it's up and running! Thanks u/ibashinu
* Post used to not display in alphabetic order - it's fixed now! Thanks u/snowflake25911 (for the menu issue, we consulted several others and they liked this more - guess we'll have to hear more opinions) 
* The rating form was too chunky and it was at the top  - we've added a 'expand/hide' option so people who are interested in submitting can click that, so it saves space. thanks u/jajanizer
* Some small issues were all addressed
* We're looking into the Excel compilation of course averages, and we're looking into how to improve the graphics design of the tables, as well as mobile apps
* We will be looking into a privacy policy that will comply with The General Data Protection Regulation from EU; for now we do use cookies (only so that 1 person does not submit multiple reviews for the same course, but we should ask, we know)",0

"Taking MATH 247 instead MATH 223 (required) I'm posting this here since I don't know who I should e-mail.

Is it possible to take [MATH 247](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2018-2019/courses/math-247) (Honours Applied Linear Algebra) instead of [MATH 223](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2017-2018/courses/math-223) (Linear Algebra) as part of a computer science major?

Math 223 is a requirement for my major, but if it is structured like Math 222, then I'd be spending a month reviewing notions I already remember. Math 247 looks way more fun.

Anyway, given that McGill does not let students repeat courses I wanted to take math 255 to show to grad schools that I know analysis. My plan is to go to grad school for probability and as such analysis is very important. I was just wondering what your thoughts are on a majors math student taking math 255.

"New course, COMP 564, opens next semester for CS grads and U3s COMP 564 (**Advanced Computational Biology Methods and Research**) will be given for the first time next semester by Jerome Waldispuhl. It is a new course code and course name but it has been given 4-5 times already as a topics course (COMP 598). The name of the course is a bit misleading as it is called ""Advanced Computational Biology Methods and Research"", but it is not really advanced. The idea of the course is to be a follow-up to COMP 561, the main Computational Biology graduate course at McGill, but it can be taken without 561 as there is no overlap between the two, they are totally complementary, and given in different semesters.

The course is focused on computational analysis and prediction of RNA and protein structure, in other words how can we predict the structure of an RNA or protein from its sequence/a gene. This is interesting because structure is typically closely linked to function, so the predictions lead to figuring out what the biological function associated with a gene is, computationally. Pragmatically, the course is focused on algorithms applied to biological problems, and there are not many applied algorithms courses at McGill so if you really enjoyed COMP 251 and/or 360 and/or are curious about how algorithms can be designed to answer real-life problems, that course could be of interest to you even if you don't have any biology background. 

No biology background is assumed! All you need is a general curiosity for it (there is relatively little biology covered in the course and that background will be covered in class). If you are a U3 in CS, **the only real requirement for COMP 564 is COMP 251** as you need to be somewhat familiar with algorithm (mostly dynamic programming). The instructor has n training in Biology, and most people who do research in Computational Biology have a mathematics background.  U3s/grads in CS will definitely all do well.

What makes COMP 564 particularly enjoyable in my opinion is that it's a relatively discreet grad course (15-30 students) so you get a lot of access to the prof and a lot of discussion in class, and while the coursework is about average for 3 credits, the grades are typically very high because most of the evaluation is project-based. The course including a research component could help you get involved in research if that is something you are considering.

I just thought I could post this here since that course does not get much attention as it does not have Machine Learning in its title (even though Computational Biology research at mcgill is very much machine learning-based). Feel free to hit me up with any questions!

So just curious, will the exam questions be different？ or will the two professors' grading be different for ECON295? Why such divergence on the ratings?

Thank you for reading this, I am just really confused as it is my first year here and I have no idea which one to choose. If the exam questions and grading will be the same I would rather switch the session, but if not I am definitely sticking to the current schedule.",0

The linked e-calendar page lists BIOL 112 as a pre-requisite; given that I'm taking the COMP course as an elective, the Bio pre-req shouldn't matter, right? If anyone has some insight into how challenging I might find the course, going in without any bio knowledge, I'd love to hear it.

"U1 PHAR MAJOR SCHEDULE ADVICE Hey everyone! I have a question for science majors out there. 

I'm in my second year, U1, as a pharmacology major. This past term I took all the courses that pharm majors have to take: BIO 200, CHEM 212, PHGY 209, PHGY 212, PHAR 200 (which is an easy A but only 1 credit), plus my elective (which was MUAR 211, another easy A). Honestly I found this semester to be really tough, even though I studied as much as I physically could for BIO/PHGY/CHEM, and my GPA took a hit. 

Next semester Im taking BIOC 212, PHGY 210, PHGY 213, CHEM 222, PHAR 201, plus an elective. I'm currently thinking COMP 250 because I took COMP 202 and really liked it &amp; did well, although I had prior knowledge of Java and I actually spent a lot of time doing the assignments for 202. I want to take COMP 250 because I feel like it would be interesting and I haven't heard particularly horrible things about it (as in; I heard the exams are fair and the material isn't insanely difficult or whatever), but I'm also desperately trying to raise my GPA (bc I need to get into grad school!!). 

Does anyone have any advice?  Does BIOC 212, PHGY 210, PHGY 213, CHEM 222, PHAR 2O1 and COMP 250 seem manageable?? Or should I stick to a guaranteed easy-A for an elective?

"Advice for U2 Econ Courseload ? I'm considering taking Econ 546 (Game Theory) with Lingling, Econ 347 (Economics of Climate Change) with Cairns, Econ 330D2 (Macroeconomics) with Mayssun, plus one 200-level elective. I've only taken one 300-level econ course besides 330, and no 400-level courses, so the 500-level of Game Theory is a bit scary. This is also the first time I've had Lingling as a prof, and she seems a little intense (""The final is going to be reeeeally challenging"" , ""This is going to be a loooot of work"", etc). I've never had Cairns before either, and his ratings are pretty bad, but his evaluation (3 in-class tests and 2 short essays) does not seem too bad (I think ?).

&amp;#x200B;

Is this doable ? I'm wondering if I should take Econ 447 before 546, and / or if I should run away from Cairns as his ratings suggest. I don't want to find myself in the middle of the semester realising too late that I took on too much... Advice or insight is appreciated !

Econ 230/240 vs 208/209 [deleted],0
"Econ 208/209 vs Econ 230/330 I'm in engineering but I want to take an economics minor. From what I understand, the math in 208/209 is kind of trivial, but the topics are the same. I don't want to waste my time in 208/209 if it will only give me a superficial understanding where I feel like I haven't learned anything. How different are these two courses streams? I know I have to take 230 over 208 anyways though because I'm in engineering. 


Also, one issue is I only have two years left of school to fit 18 economics courses in. If I take 330 in my last year, will that prevent me from taking certain electives, or would proffs usually give me the okay?

"Opinion about ISLA 522 ? Hi,

I'm tempted to take ISLA 522 (Lower Intermediate Arabic) this summer and go up to ISLA 525 hopefully later on.

I am not from McGill and each session would cost me about 1k$. 

According to those who took it, would it be worth it ? It's a huge goal of me to reach fluency in Arabic and it seems to me that the courses offered here are the best suited for that.

Thanks!",0

"Pros and Cons of Taking Classes Away from McGill during the Summer? I'm currently a U1 student studying Computer Science and Statistics. I am planning on taking the following math courses at UBC over the summer:

Math 222 (Calculus 3) - May to June (to be confirmed by course equivalency).

Math 323 (Probability) - May to June

Math 314 (Advanced Calculus) - July to August

Pros:

These classes will be pass/fail as it is taken at an external institution.

I'm doing a double major and 2 minors so it decreases some time I have to spend at McGill.

I have a reliable tutor back at home that I can turn to if I run into trouble.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm afraid of:

I'm looking into applying to graduate school (Data Science) later on, so I'm afraid it would look bad to schools if I take these classes over the summer, especially pass fail. Any thoughts/advice?

I have not taken Algebra 1 or Analysis 1 which I heard is helpful for advanced calculus. Can anyone confirm?

I know that summer school cramming isn't the wisest option for learning but would any of the later classes in the Statistics program rely heavily on Math 314? Or is it just the kind of course where we must take it but once it's over, it's over?

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my year planned out:

2019 SUMMER (9):

MATH 222 (MATH 200) Calculus 3 - 3 

MATH 323 (MATH 302) Probability - 3

MATH 314 (MATH 317) Advanced Calculus - 3 

2019 FALL (13.5):

MATH 235 Algebra 1 - 3 FALL ONLY 

MATH 324 Statistics - 3 

EAST 340 D1 Second Level Japanese - 4.5 

LING 201 Introduction to Linguistics - 3 

2019 WINTER (13.5):

MATH 236 Algebra 2 - 3 WINTER ONLY

I really need your help.. would this be a dumb idea to proceed with? ,0

also does anyone have any idea on how minoring in a language works? like i know there is a placement test but where do i take that and how is the whole process

and lastly, how hard is it to switch majors (specifically from anat to physiology) at the end of u1? i am still stuck between these two majors. is there any way i can make my schedule so that both options are possible at the end of u1?

"Advice for Calculus 3 (MATH 222) Hey /r/mcgill!

I'm a management student with 1 year to go before graduation; I'll be graduating Winter 2020. In my last year, I was looking to take some math classes because I have some room for electives and I am increasingly interested in doing an economics masters after my BCom (which I know is a little more math intensive). As of now, I think I'm eyeing MATH 141 (Fall 2019), MATH 223 (Fall 2019), MATH 222 (Winter 2020), and MATH 324 (Winter 2020).

I did both Cal I and Cal II in Cegep and scored 99 and 96, respectively. However, this was Commerce calculus and was like 3 years ago. I'm looking to do Cal III and Probability in Winter 2020 and was wondering if it's advised to do Cal II again in Fall 2019 as a refresher or if I should just jump into Cal III. My advisor has told me that redoing Cal II will appear as an E in my transcript, to signify exclusion. This is fine by me as I don't need the credits for graduation and don't really care about the cost for the 4 credits.

I personally think redoing Cal II would be beneficial and in my best interest if I'm looking to do well in Cal III. I guess I could review Cal I and Cal II notes and use online resources over the summer to prep myself but I doubt it would have the same effect as actually taking it during the Fall semester.

What would you do?

Thanks in advance for any advice and good luck with your finals!",0

"Questions about course selection for graduate school (COMP) I'm starting an [M.Sc](https://M.Sc) (thesis) in Computer Science in the Fall, and I'm interested to hear how people go about course selection. A few of the courses that I planned on taking are not being offered next year, so I am left to pick two courses that won't be very closely related to what I want to research. The unfortunate part is that if I try to take more relevant courses that are more ""indirectly relevant"", I'm worried my background won't be strong enough.

&amp;#x200B;

My main question I guess is, for these two courses (out of six), whether it would be wiser to take courses that I'm more prepared for at the cost of being less relevant, or take the more relevant courses and attempt learn the background material independently. I'm leaning towards the latter, because these courses naturally sound more interesting to me and I think I'll enjoy putting in the work, but at the same time I don't yet have an appreciation for how difficult these courses are. What do you guys think?

&amp;#x200B;

To be more specific, I want to do research in reinforcement learning. I'm considering taking COMP 553 in the Fall, because I think game theory could be motivating for AI research, but I couldn't take COMP 360 during my undergrad because I'm a comp eng (however I have already learned some concepts out of personal interest, such as LP). In the Winter I'm considering one of MATH 545 (time series), MATH 560 (optimization, but suggests having an analysis background which I don't have), and COMP 531 (might be nice for proving complexity bounds and approximation algorithms, but my theory of computation background is entirely self-taught and not terribly rigorous). If I don't pick courses from this list,  I cannot find anything very relevant to the field at all outside the courses that I already plan on taking.",0

My advisor recommended taking it at Concordia in the fall since I’m so nervous about taking it. When I was looking into doing this last year the prof and class had really horrible reviews/class average. I mentioned this to my advisor and he said that no matter what it would be easier than taking it at McGill. 

Does anyone have any experience having taken math courses at McGill and Concordia? If so how do they compare?

"COMP251 vs COMP252 I am a U1 student pursuing a (hopefully) honours degree in Computer Science and Biology. 

COMP252 (taught by Dr. Devroye in N2/2) is required for the honours or it can be replaced with 6 credits 400 level and above, including 3 credits 500 level and above in electives. 

This class coincides with PHYS102, which I will also be taking, and attendance counts for 5% of the course. 

I’ve heard that Dr. Devroye doesn’t record lectures or post notes. 

Alternatively, I could take COMP251 (taught by Dr. Verra in LEA132) and take extra high level courses in the future. Does he post notes/record lectures?

Any advice about which option seems to be better would be helpful!

Also, any tips about these courses/profs would be very much appreciated :)

On a side note, I’ve heard that, although not a prerequisite, COMP206 should be taken before COMP251/252. Can anyone confirm/deny this? I plan on taking both in Winter.

EDIT: It seems like some people misunderstood and thought I was in U0 due to the PHYS102 course selection. I am entering U1 after poor freshman course selection.",0

I took Calc 1 in high school and did pretty well in it and passed the AP Calc AB exam when I took it (3). When I had to take this course again in my first semester at Mac campus I failed it. I was overconfident in my math skills and barely studied for the exams but got perfect scores on all the assignments.

"Comp Schedule Advice TL;DR: Is taking MATH 235 worth it as a non-math major?

I am currently taking MATH 133 and I am really enjoying the material/concepts. Now I'm considering taking MATH 235 as an elective but its considered equivalent to MATH 240 which I am currently registered for. 

I'd appreciate any advice on the pros and cons of taking 235 instead of 240 and why I could take 240 before 235 but not vice-versa? The course descriptions are very different but I'm assuming the concepts in 235 are more abstract while in 240 they are more applied. A prof recommended taking 240 before 235 as a non-math student. I could/would also take 235 as an S/U if that is significant.

My schedule would also be COMP 250, 206, MATH 235 S/U, 323, PSYC 211 in the fall and my winter would be COMP 251, 302, NSCI 201, POLI 420, (possibly) MATH 236 S/U.

"5 science-oriented classes all with labs - is this possible? Hey, I'm going into my U1 year at McGill in the fall. My major is environmental biology at the Mac campus.

Registration is coming up and I'm looking at the classes I'll need to take in my first semester. The recommended U1 first semester courses are all science oriented and each has a lab section.  So, 5 classes with 5 labs. The courses are Organisms 1, 2 ecosystems-related courses, Genetics and Organic chem. A total of 16 credits (organic = 4).

I'm generally a good student but this seems a bit intimidating to me. Especially considering that organic is one of the classes, since chemistry isn't really my forte and I've heard that it's challenging.

Thing is, if I don't take all of these classes in my first semester, I was told that I will probably fall behind in my studies as I would be missing pre-reqs for other courses. Since I want to graduate in 3 years, this would not be ideal.

"What classes can you take to switch from Major in physics to Honours physics? Hello,

so I was told to go into the Physics Major in my first year instead of going directly into the Honours program. I have not taken Calculus III, which means I will have to take a 6 classes semester at some point. I could at least choose two ""easier"" electives during that semester. One of my questions is: 

how can you take the courses (bottom of this page [http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/ugrads/honours.html#switch](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/ugrads/honours.html#switch)):

MATH 222 (3) Calculus 3  
MATH 223 (3) Linear Algebra  
MATH 314 (3) Advanced Calculus  
MATH 315 (3) Ordinary Differential Equations  
[PHYS 230](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/ugrads/200.html#230) (3) Dynamics of Simple Systems

[PHYS 258](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/ugrads/200.html#258) (3) Experimental Methods 2

in one year, without taking 6 courses in one semester? Is it pretty much impossible? Would 6 classes, in that case, be too much? Am I better off going into the Honours program right away since there is a workable path on the Honours physics page (and also how do you do that? Do you just have to register to the Honours classes?). 

I know there are numerous questions in this post, but any help would be appreciated!

By the way, I am coming to Uni from a CEGEP.

"How hard is Math 133 actually? I guess the title here speaks for itself: what are everyone's impressions of Math 133? I've heard a lot of polarizing opinions ranging from ""easiest class I've ever taken"" to ""GPA killer, don't take it if you don't have to.""

I might have to take it because it's a requirement for a minor that I'm considering. I'm not really a math person, but I'm not terrible at it either. More into the softer sciences, but I can handle math as long as I put in extra work.

I'd like to get to the bottom of this: how do most people actually feel about that class? How's the workload/is it manageable alongside CHEM 212/BIOL 200 etc.? Am I being ridiculous by evaluating my potential minor choices on the difficulty of an introductory Linear Algebra course?

"[Question] How do i replace Organic 1? Pharmacology Major Im starting Pharmacology in the fall and i'm unsure about how to replace my organic 1 course that i have already done in cegep. Since this is a 4 credit course would i need to replace it with one of the complementary classes listed plus an elective? This would give me 14 credits for the semester (6 classes) and i'm not sure if this is okay. Or do i need to replace it with another 4 credit 200 class to make a 12 credit semester (5 classes)? If this is the case, what are some 4 credit classes i am allowed to replace it with?

I also noticed that the complementary courses for the usually in Year 1 list are only offered in the winter. Would i be able to take a 200 level course that's under the usually in Year 2 list such as CHEM 203, CHEM 204, MATH 203 or PSYC 204?

Should I only take 200 level courses as a first year U1 student? I'm planning on doing a BA in History (specifically honours history) and have a question regarding how many 200 level courses I should be taking in my first fall semester. Is it true that I should be only taking 200 level courses in my first (fall) semester? I know that I technically can take 300 level courses but all the 300 level history courses I am interested in have prerequisites - are these perquisites binding and should I take them at face value? The problem I have with taking only 200 level courses is A) I will be using up most of my 200 level courses in one semester when I might want to take them later on and B) apparently 300 level (history courses in particular) courses can be more interesting as they are more focused.,0

I know most of the python basics, I just don't have much experience with hands-on coding experience in the language. I'm a beginner in NLP theory so are there sufficient resources and practice material to do well? The final project seems really interesting and something I've never done before. What are some important aspects to keep in mind for the final project? 

I'm willing to put in the work, I'm just trying to gauge my semester because I'm also taking Comp 360 which can also be difficult.

1)Is taking these kinds of courses all together going to be too challenging? Considering 340 and 347 together especially.

The 250 syllabus suggests I complete calc 1 before I take this course. My math background includes only what I completed at a US high school, nothing in uni. Does my A in 202 still bode well for 250 given that my math will not be as strong as the others in the course? I have resources everywhere at my fingertips; I just want to gauge how much I will need them.",0

I'm a BCom student (major in economics, minor in finance) in my last year; I'm taking MATH 242 (Analysis 1) as an elective this semester.

As is probably the case for most students in the class, this is my first introduction to more theoretical/proof-based math, which is obviously different from the more computational math I've seen in calculus, economics, or finance.

Is there anything you'd recommend to help study for this class, other than attending lectures, tutorials, etc.?  Is there a really great Youtube channel or other online resource that helps with the material, for example?

"Advice on Math 141 Hey mcgill people,

I'm in MATH 141 right now and am feeling a little lost. My situation is a little weird, though probably not unheard of:

I had my first year back in 2015, where I had some mental health issues that led to me missing TONS of class and either failing or late-withdrawing from most of my courses across both semesters. Of those, Math 140 was one of the few that I did complete after deferring the exam into the summer. I had a tutor over the summer who helped me get up to the point where I could pass the course with a C, after having a 0 on basically everything except for the exam.

After taking a couple years off and getting my head on straight i came back and now i'm in Math 141, except that i remember dick-all from 140. I still have an understanding of the concepts from 140 but i'm a ways off from being able to actually apply them and be comfortable taking derivatives or really solving most problems on a math 140 exam. Can still take limits alright though.

Anyways, so far I'm managing the webwork in 141 and can do the algebra, but the stuff that relies heavily on knowledge of 140 is tripping me up. I'm trying to review old 140 notes and get up to speed, but theres a ton of content to cover.

I guess what I'm looking for is someone who can give me some tips about what specifically from 140 i need to review, since I know not all of it is actually used in 141. What are the key skills/rules I need to be able to apply?

If anyone can either give some advice about it, or even recommend a tutor who might be able to help me out I'd appreciate greatly :)",0

"Science Freshman/U0 Requirement Exemptions I'm a Comp Sci major aiming to graduate in Winter 2020. I had all my courses perfectly laid out, until I went in to my advisor today to check if I everything was good.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I was told that MATH 122 (Calculus for Management) that I took before my transfer to Science is not equivalent to MATH 140 (Calculus 1), even though I was told previously by Mary Gauthier that it would be and that I would be exempt from MATH 140. Now I have to take an additional Freshman requirement course in order to graduate. I'd much rather take another higher level COMP course than PHYS 101 or something. To make this even more infuriating I can't just take Calculus 1 for an easy A, since it's not available to students who have taken MATH 122. Like wtf m8

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if anyone else here has successfully been exempted from MATH 140 using MATH 122 in the past, or if anyone has been able to obtain exemptions from the U0 requirements through any other method.

"Need some last minute help changing my schedule before the add/drop deadline im currently enrolled in ECSE 211 (DPM), ECSE 321 (Intro to software eng, agile team project), ECSE 324 (Computer Organization, vhdl assembly labs), COMP 206 (linux and C) and PHYS 224 (Physics of music). Its a great schedule, I just feel that I might be overwhelmed with DPM and ECSE 321 which are both (team project classes) and ECSE 324 which is lab heavy. COMP 206 and PHYS 224 are both easy and cover material I already somewhat know. 

Option A) dropping 324 (especially since the teacher is terrible this year) and just pushing it back until F20. This would make a 12 credit semester. 

Option B) dropping phys 224. I don't want to take it S/U because I know that its a GPA booster

Option 3) dropping 324 (same as A) but taking a later class like FACC 400 or COMP 302 (programming paradigms).

&amp;#x200B;

Some more info, I will also be taking ECSE 428 and ECSE 223 in W20, both of which are group project classes. Additionally I am scheduled to take ECSE 310, MATH 240 and COMP 251 in W20, but I will probably postpone 310 since it's not a prereq for anything and that feels like too heavy a semester. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I only took 13 credits in W19 and that was my best semester by far in terms of GPA.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, I could somehow spend less time on dpm and ecse 321 than is expected, but I feel like that would ruin my enjoyment of both courses.

&amp;#x200B;

So Im thinking just suck it up and take 2 team project and 2 regular ENG classes in F19 and W20? I don't want to be overwhelmed but also I don't want to just waste a semester and take 12 credits.",0

"Taking extra courses/swapping out courses for my degree in Physics Hi all,

So I'm going to be applying to McGill for next Fall pretty soon, and I'm starting to have a change of heart when it comes to my program of choice. Initially, I was set on going into Honours Math and Physics, but now I'm thinking I might want to go into just Honours Physics. My reason for this is my extreme love-hate relationship with math. I've been self-studying Math and Physics for a really long time now. I've worked through essentially all the Physics textbooks McGill uses (except Stat mech and QFT) and I've consistently enjoyed each subject in Physics.

With Math, however, I can't say the same. I've found I love certain parts of math, but absolutely detest others. For example, I love Tensor analysis/Differential geometry. I also love Differential equations, in particular, Partial differential equations. On the other hand, I can't stand analysis. I find it to be really quite dull but I do really want to take at least one class in analysis because I know how important it is to have some basic mathematics under my belt. 

So my question is, can I take maybe 3-4 extra math classes for an Honours Physics degree? Maybe Analysis 1, Differential geometry, and Partial differential equations (500 level)?

Also, can I choose to switch certain courses in my degree for others? I wanted to take Math 358 instead of Math 248 (My idea is that Math 358 would serve as better preparation for Differential geometry then math 248). Can I also switch out a course like Phys 241 with the engineering version ECSE 206? I worked as a summer intern in Prof. Chen's lab and I really wanted to take to his class on S&amp;S.

If I have completed all U1 courses and all U2 chem courses (302, 362, 214) and U2 complimentary at the end of this year, I could fit all of the remaining U2 and the four U3 courses into next year: just 8 courses.

One problem: would need to take BIOC 311 as a coreq w/ BIOC 450 and 454, with 312 and 470 (which not a problem because 311 is only prereq) in the winter.

Would this be allowed/doable with instructor permission?

"Would I get in trouble for selling BIOL 301 worksheets? So I'm in BIOL 301 this semester and I was thinking of selling my lab worksheets next semester for like $10 or something.

I'm wondering if the buyer ignores this and brings them into the lab I would also get in trouble? Or is it safer to just not sell them at all? Thanks!",0

I was wondering from those who have previous taken PHIL 210 in the last few years, how you prepped for the final? I'm nervous because I do understand some concepts in the course and have done well in the assignments/midterm due to having unlimited attempts and lots of trial and error but I feel my knowledge in the course is at a very basic level and some of the proofs given to us to ""prep"" with have got me distraught. Also, I'm wondering if previous finals had any informal proofs? 

also, in the syllabus the prof mentions that you must pass the final in order to pass the course (exam is worth 50%) regardless of previous assignments. Does this mean that an F in the final would discount all the previous 50% worth of work done and the whole grade would be F?",0

I didn't understand or remember any calculus (except the most basic stuff like how f(x) = 2(x^2) differentiates to f'(x) = 4x) when I did math in high school, but I scored enough on the non-calculus parts of my exam to get credits for 140.


Anyway since I am taking 141 soon, and I don't want to fall behind from the very start, I think I should study the James Stewart textbook over the holidays. But I am not too sure which chapters are covered by 140 (is it chapter 1 to 4, and 9?), and which ones are covered by 141. Would appreciate it if anyone could please send me the syllabus for 140 and 141.


Just how much 140 knowledge do I need for 141, and is studying the textbook and doing textbook questions the best way for me to acquire the background knowledge I need for 141?",0
"Looking for Class Using R or Stata Hey /r/mcgill!

Hope finals went well for everyone :)

I’m a Management student entering my last semester. I’m currently looking for an elective to take in Winter that uses R or Stata to get some practice with those. 

I think MATH 208 would (potentially?) be what I’m looking for, however it isn’t offered in Winter. Not sure whether to look in math, comp, econ, busa, etc. 

I heard Income Distribution (400 level Econ) uses Stata but I’m not sure if this is true.

"Advice for Winter Semester Math Classes Hey /r/mcgill!

Hope everyone's having a nice holiday break.

I'm thinking of taking MATH 223 (Jeremy MacDonald) and MATH 315 (Rosalie Belanger-Rioux) as electives this upcoming semester (which is my last). I'm debating taking one of them pass/fail.

For some background information, this semester I took Calculus 3 and Analysis 1. I really enjoyed the former as it was more applied but struggled quite a bit in the latter as it was my first proof-based math course. I can't really say I enjoyed Analysis at all, despite having a really decent professor too. I got a B+ in Calc 3 and B in Analysis, if that matters at all.

How do these courses compare to MATH 222 and MATH 242? Are they generally more difficult, more time-consuming, more theoretical, proof-heavy, etc.?

(Should I focus more on assignment functions, or the examples in the slides, etc) For some background info, I’ve felt that the assignments haven’t been too challenging and the content isn’t breaking my mind, so it’s not like I’m starting out with nothing here but I have heard that the midterms have had notoriously low averages...

"ECON 313/314 Hello! I plan on taking ECON 313 during the summer and was wondering if it's best to schedule ECON 314  right after it during the fall or if could take 314 the next summer? Is a year too big of a gap? 

My biggest concern are the maths, as I prefer to take math classes during the summer rather than during regular semesters where I have to handle other courses as well.

"ITAL &amp; HISP simultaneously Hey!

I'm U3 and will have only one course to take in Fall 2020 before graduating. I'm taking Italian intensive this semester and I believe I'm half way through intermediate in Spanish (learned it at cegep+another uni). I was considering taking uncredited language courses from other schools but found out they are pricier than McGill's. 

So now I am wondering how stupid it is to take HISP and ITAL intensive during the same semester with my other remaining course. They resemble each other a lot but I also feel I would've learned them for nothing if I don't end up near fluent.

I also speak French as a first language if that can change anything lol

"""XX"" equivalent courses Hi :) I'm \*supposed to\* go on exchange next winter. I've been looking at equivalent courses abroad and noticed that some courses are equivalent to a certain ""level"" at McGill (ex. GEOG 2XX).

"Comp 202 or Psyc 304 for Summer Semester hey from an indecisive mcgill student looking for advice on summer courses!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently between Comp 202 and Psyc 304 and I'd love some input on which is a better course to take for this summer, since there is literally nothing else to do in quarantine... RIP

&amp;#x200B;

Some useful info... I'm majoring in anatomy &amp; cell biology and doing a minor in psyc. Psyc 304 would count towards my minor, comp 202 would be an elective, but is always helpful to have some coding experience in the science world.

&amp;#x200B;

Comp 202 is with Jonathan Campbell, runs three days a week for 1.5 hours  from May-June.

Psyc 304 is with Stephane Gaskin, runs four days a week for 2.5 hours for just May.

&amp;#x200B;

Is one course better than the other to take over the summer? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks so much, stay safe out (really, in) there :)))))

"MATH 141 Winter/Summer? Scared Hi,

I am a U2 student who is re-taking MATH 141 and the only options i have to take it now are: May, July, and the fall. I am terrible at math (hence re-taking it). I've been reading the ""reviews"" of the MATH 141 exam for the Winter and am terrified. No way can I do a proof-based exam. I am currently registered for May.

Advantages to taking it in May: online, different instructor, could be somewhat easier (although faster-paced)

Disadvantages to taking it in May: I'm volunteering in COVID-19 relief, and taking an online clinical course. Its online, so the exam may be the same.

Advantages to taking it in the Fall: maybe a different instructor, could be in-person, easier final exam compared to this online exam

Disadvantages to taking it in the Fall: not having enough time to go to the lecture in-person, general super busy school life

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: Do you guys think May is enough time for them to reformat the exam to be easier? Alternatively, is the semester Fall likely to be online, thereby producing the same results? I'm terrified of the MATH 141 exam now.",0

"CHEM 212 as a co-requisite for BIOL 200 Hi everyone, U0 science student here.

I'm planning on taking Molecular Biology (BIOL 200) in the fall, and was thinking that I'd need to take at least the lecture part of Organic Chemistry (CHEM 212) over the summer because it's a co-requisite for BIOL 200, and CHEM 212 doesn't fit in my fall schedule with some of my other mandatory classes. I emailed my Faculty of Science Advisor and he told me that CHEM 212 is no longer a co-requisite so I won't have to take it at all, since it's not necessary for any other courses in my degree. The e-calendar still says it's mandatory, so I also asked the Department of Biology Advisor. She told me that they were thinking of removing it since they are currently revising the course, but they decided to keep it as a co-requisite. She also said that unofficially I could take CHEM 212 after BIOL 200 if it worked better with my schedule.

I really don't want to take Organic Chemistry, for obvious reasons. I've heard that pre/co-requisites aren't really enforced in the Faculty of Science unless you feel you need them, and it seems like people I've talked to don't think anything more than CHEM 110/120 is necessary - can anyone confirm this? If I never took Organic Chemistry, would it really matter? Do they check, and would I still get credit for BIOL 200?

TL;DR: I don't want to take CHEM 212, but it's a co-requisite for BIOL 200 which I need. What would happen if I just never took it?

Thanks!",0

"Comp 204 or Comp 202? Hi,

I’m a U1 art&amp;sci student majoring in organismal biology and anthropology. I’m thinking of taking a comp summer course here to learn python. I’m currently thinking of choosing one of comp202 and comp204. 

I have limited (almost zero) coding experience before, so I think taking either one would be a challenge. I’ve heard that 204 is specifically made for life sci students but have no idea exactly how / why. Speaking of level of difficulty and content, what are the differences between these two classes? If I just want to learn python for logical training and possible future use (not professional but like a useful tool), which one would you recommend?

"How feasible is it to do OChem without doing Gen Chem in U0? So I am quite positive that I would be able to get my AP Chemistry credit; I am a decent student in Chem so far overall and I am pretty sure that I could do well in CHEM 110/120. However, with the AP credit, I would not be allowed to take Gen Chem for credit, which makes me start to consider taking CHEM 212 (OChem 1) in my first semester of U0. What my question really is is, does Gen Chem have a lot of transferrable skills to OChem? I've looked up posts on this sub and the extent to which I've seen is that some people comment on the fact that OChem lab skills can't be developed via Gen Chem as the techniques are different; there's no other comment on the actual course compared to 110/120.

As some background, I am planning on taking MATH 150, PHYS 131, MATH 133 and CHEM 212 in my U0 1st semester. I'm taking CHEM 212 because I will be needing it to fulfil my Biophysics prereqs.",0

"PHIL book recommendations? I'm in neuro. After finals, I started reading 'The Marvelous Clouds' by John Durham Peters on the philosophy of media (fire, sea, sky, timekeeping, etc.). I added it to my reading list after seeing it on one of the shelves of the McGill bookstore for a PHIL course. It's been an awesome read so far but because this subject matter is out of my academic comfort zone, I'm reaching out for help in looking for works of similar difficulty and entertainment value. 

What else have you read as a phil student in your time at McGill? Are there any noteworthy books you believe to be worth sharing? My interest is rooted in having taken PSYC 403 (history of psych). I can't say I enjoyed the class itself but now that the final is over and done with, I find myself frequently reflecting on what I've learned. 

I'm not a PHIL student myself bc (a) I didn't know how relevant/varied/vibrant the field could be, and (b) my GPA would tank if I had to complete such readings for the purpose of subsequent evaluation. I'm open to any &amp; all suggestions. I don't know enough about the different branches/types of phil to really yet know what interests me. Thanks, all the best :)",0

The professor in mycourses said the following:
&gt;Exams will have to be different than they have in the past to minimize the possibilities of cheating.  As a department we are exploring how this goes in the large 200 level courses offered in Jan-Apr 2020.  I suspect (but do not know at the time of writing) this will include using multiple choice questions with more potential answers (8 per questions) along with making those questions ""choose all of the correct answers and none of the incorrect answers"" types as well as open ended problem solving questions. 

and 

&gt;If I were a student who did not need this course right now, I would defer taking Biol202 in the winter of 2021.  For those who do stick with the course, I hope it turns out well for you.

As essentially the professor is recommending to not take the course he is teaching unless you need it lol, should I S/U BIOL 202?

I was having two finals on the same day when doing analysis 1 and unfortunately Analysis 1 was the second one in the afternoon.

Of course we were graded on our English skills, however we learned about fairytales and we even watched the film Stardust (2007) lmao.

In my first year here, I took ECON 227, which are statistics in economics. I am planing on taking MATH 324 (Statistics in mathematics) during the Fall 2021 semester. When I looked at the description of the course and went through past syllabus, I saw that the material in that course is very similar to the one we studied in ECON 227. 
My problem here is that I am also planing on taking MATH 423 (Regression and Analysis of Variance) in Fall 2021, for which I need to have taken previously MATH 324. 

So has anyone here ever been in this situation and do you think it is feasible to take MATH 423 and MATH 324 simultaneously as I've already seen the majority of the MATH 324 material in ECON 227?",0

I'm taking ISLA 380: Islamic philosophy and theology with Prof. Wisnovsky this Fall. If anyone has access to it, could they send me the syllabus for Fall 2020 (I can't register for the class yet)? 

And to those who've taken the class already, how is it? How is the prof, is his grading strict? Anything I should know going into the class? For reference, I'm a math &amp; philosophy major and it'll be my first (and only, unfortunately) time taking an islamic studies class. 

Thanks! hope you enjoy the last few days of summer :))",0
"Is COMP 206, COMP 251, COMP 273, MATH 240, and ECON 230 D1 doable? Hi,

I've got four options for the fall 2020 semester:

I have to take COMP 206, COMP 251, MATH 240. I can just choose between the following options for the rest of the courses:

1. COMP 273  &amp;  ECON 230 D1
2. MATH 223  &amp;  ECON 230 D1
3. COMP 273  &amp;  MATH 223
4. COMP 273  &amp;  ECON 208

I'm leaning towards the first option because it will give me more course options for the winter semester, but I'm worried it'll be too much for the fall semester, what do you'll think?

BY THE WAY, I'm more interested in taking ECON 230 rather than ECON 208 because I think it gives me a better foundation and I'm looking forward to the math.

Any input would be appreciated.

Thanks",0

"Taking notes as an engineering student. There are lectures, tutorials and, most of the time, teachers adopt flipped classroom activities, meaning that you must review the lectures by yourself before the ""class"".  I was wondering what the most efficient way is in order to efficiently systemize the aforementioned teaching methods (theoretical lectures, live lectures and tutorials). Do I need a notebook for every type of teaching method? Or should I only use a notebook for the main theory section (pre-recorded lectures)? When I was in CEGEP, I used to have a notebook for the lecture itself (theory-related) and another one for the given exercises in the textbook. Now, with the addition of live lectures and tutorials, I do not know how to organize my stuff.",0

"Taking COMP 202, 206, or 208 right now? Hi guys, I just decided to join one of the courses list in my title since I am going to replace PHYS257 with one of them. The reason I want to withdraw PHYS257 is simple, because it is delivered remotely and its subsequent  course PHYS258 may also going to be delivered remotely next year due to the pandemic (according to the provost from email, all courses in winter is going to be delivered remotely.) So I don't find it is helpful to study experimental method online without any hand on experience.

Therefore, I decide to switch this course with one of COMP202/COMP206/COMP208. Since I don't have any experience on programming so i think if i can take those courses, which will make me having a good preparation before next year when I am going to retake PHYS257.

"Taking MATH 141 + 240 [First Year BA CS] \[TL;DR: First year BA CS, I got destroyed by 5 courses including MATH 133+140 on fall, I'm currently signed up for 141 and 240 at once for winter, with a slightly lower workload from the rest of my courses. Do you guys reckon this is a good idea? if not, what COMP course (if any) would you suggest I replace MATH 240 with?\]  


Hey,

So I've been getting destroyed this term and found myself unable to do anything beside study and still got grades I am not particularly fond of. Due to this, I've decided to have a 4(+1) course winter. For reference: semester is currently set as: MATH 141+240, COMP 273, COMP396, FRSL102. 

&amp;#x200B;

The (+1) is 396, and I'm formatting it that way, because I've basically found a way to get one of my hobbies to count for 396 and only write an end paper on it in about a week or so. It's a full course worth of work yes, but crucially it's work I love and am capable at and would have done regardless of credit.

&amp;#x200B;

MATH 133+140 were the main thing that hit me super hard during Fall. So, I feel like I'm still going to run into the same issue with 141 and 240 at once, will I? I don't want to feel genuinely terrible through a second semester.

If you reckon it'll be hard doing both the MATH courses at once, What COMP course would you suggest I replace 240 with if any?   


The reason I specify comp is that I sadly do not have my full program certain in my head, and if I choose a Double Major or take the Supplementary Minor, I won't get any more electives. Hence, I am kind of stuck within the confines of getting credit for my CS degree.",0

"Information/advice about upper-level psych classes Hi,

Hope that your semester has been manageable and exams are going well. Not sure if this is the best place to ask, but I am looking for any information on PSYC412, 443, 471, and  541. If you've taken multiple of these classes, I would love to know what you found more useful :). 

I know PSYC412 (Developmental Psychopathology)  is full, and I am not sure if Prof. Bagot is teaching 443. I think the one I would like to take the most is 443 (Affective Neuroscience), however, 541 (Multilevel Modelling) would be great but I don't meet the prereqs. I think I would take 471 if I could not get into one of these courses. It's my last semester so I want to take something interesting (good grades are a plus).

Similarly, I've read diverging ideas about MATH 323 Probability for AI; with some saying it was crucial for the course and other saying that I could really well just take 2-3 hours to review the necessary concepts on  my own and do very well in COMP424, without the need to take MATH323 (which I don't really want to take as I'd rather save some space for cooler comp classes). What do you think, could I do that? Or is this course really fundamental (or fun) and worth taking anyway? If not for COMP424, is it *crucial* for other courses (like COMP551 ML)? And what about MATH324 (Statistics)?

note: I've already taken a bit of probability in high school, which overlaps with 1/3-1/2 of the course, though I've forgotten most of it

Telling students what the course is about in more detail? Letting them know what the grading scheme is? Enlightening them about the class structure? Shouldn't that be the bare minimum? 

Also does anyone have the ling 215 syllabus? And does anyone know where I can find syllabuses on mycourses (I remember there was a specific tab where you could search amongst the uploaded syllabuses).

Thanks for coming to my tedtalk.",0

"Upper-level PoliSci Courses W2021 Hi, 

I'm trying to find a good 400-level (or higher) political science course to take this semester. After taking really dry/boring courses last semester, I'm hoping to find a course with an engaging professor. Looking for a class with a leftist/critical theory focus as most of the polisci courses I've taken for my degree have been very liberal. 

Wondering if anyone has taken a course with Professor William Roberts. He's teaching POLI 561 (Honors Seminar: Political Theory) this winter. The topic of the seminar is Marx's Capital. According to RateMyProfessor, he seems to be a difficult grader — however most reviews were for 300-level courses. Any insight on upper-level courses with him would be appreciated! The only theory course I've taken is POLI 231.

Further, does anyone have any feedback on Taylor Owen? He's teaching POLI 424 (cross-listed with COMS 491), which is Media and Politics. 

Besides those two courses, if anyone has any recommendations for 400+ level polisci courses that are offered this winter, I'd appreciate it!",0

"picking course for my first semester -- poli 222 or poli 227 this is my first semester at mcgill and im currently registered for nine credits with a heavy workload. i want to fill my last class with a politics course, but i'm not sure what to pick between poli 222 (prof christa sholtz) and poli 227 (prof daniel douek)

i enjoy both subjects, but know nothing about the classes, as i have no prior experience in the political science department or mcgill as a whole. i am considering a poli sci major, and  want to enroll in at least one course, but i'm scared about the potential workload.

if anyone has taken either class (or both) i would really appreciate any input you might offer. i am particularly interested in how beginner-friendly the two courses are, as well as **how heavy the workload is!!!**

extra details:

\- readings sometimes intimidate me and i tend to work better with courses that are lecture-dependent rather than reading-dependent

\- the ratemyprof reviews for the poli222 prof scared me lol

\- i have no prior knowledge of canadian government (i'm foreign lol)

\- this is my first time doing uni online

\- i am wary of heavy workloads because i struggle with time management and have a myriad of non-academic responsibilities",0

"Good PSYC 300-levels? Hey y'all! Procrastinating on studying by playing in the visual schedule builder, as you will, and wanted to ask if there are any stand-out courses as far as higher-level Psyc goes, or ones to avoid? 

 I've noticed that psyc classes tend to focus more on brute-force 'memorize 15 different individuals experiments' instead of forming a whole picture of how the systems interact. It kicked my ass when I took PSYC 211 over the summer, the studying was so different compared to how I usually study for biology-heavy courses. Given I'm going into honors, I'd rather not make the same mistake again lmao - so, any top-tier picks to prioritize?

"MIMM U3 Course Selection Advice Hello! 

I have a few questions about course selection for U3 MIMM. 

First, for anyone who has taken MIMM 466 (viral pathogenesis), how was this course? Was it better or worse than MIMM 324? I liked some parts of MIMM 324, especially Dr. Archambault's section. I'm really interested in the immune response to viral infections, and from the syllabus, it seems that's the focus of some lectures, in addition to the biology of viral replication. 

I'm also thinking about taking PHGY 513. So if you've taken that course, please let me know what it was like! From the syllabus, it seems really cool. But I can't find much about it anywhere. 

Also, this question is for anyone who was in MIMM honours. This is what I want to take for fall 2021: 

1. MIMM 414 
2. MIMM 465
3. Honour project (MIMM 501)
4. PPHS 511

Do you think this schedule would be doable? I'm unsure whether it might be too much to take three courses on top of the honours project. I don't need to take three courses, but PPHS 511 seems like so much fun! But I also want to enjoy my final year.

"COMP complementary courses Hey all, Fall 2021 will be my last semester, and I need 5 credits of complementary courses for my COMP (Arts) major in order to graduate. I was totally set on what classes I was taking, I had picked out COMP 230 and COMP 307, but now 307 has been moved to winter semester which I'm not waiting around for. I've narrowed it down to a couple options (these will be the ONLY classes I take next sem):

\- **COMP 230 + COMP 417**: of all the classes I can take COMP 230 is the one I'm most interested in. 417 seems cool, but I'm worried it will be a significant amount of work for someone like me who doesn't actually care that much about robotics.

\- **COMP 230 + MATH 318**: these seem like they might be good to take together because they're about very similar topics. I did well in PHIL 210 and COMP 330 (both about logic) and I thought MATH 240 was hard but I got a good grade. But, I'm much better at first-order logic than at actual mathematical proofs so I'm worried 318 might be over my head.

\- **COMP 321 + COMP 521**: the main pro of this is that it's exactly the 5 credits that I need, and I've heard 321 is fun; however like with 417 above, I don't have any vested interest in computer games so I'm worried that 521 will be too much work for something I don't care about.

Ideally I'd take COMP 598 Data Science with Ruths and then either COMP 230 or COMP 321, but the first combo is conflicting times and the second combo isn't enough credits. I'm looking for input on any of these choices, or if you have other suggestions specifically for courses that run in the Fall be my guest! Keep in mind though that I've only taken MATH 222, MATH 223, MATH 240, COMP 250, COMP 206, COMP 273, COMP 251, COMP 303, COMP 330, COMP 598 (Privacy in Mobile App Dev with Robillard), so as much as the LING major in me would love NLP, I don't have the prereqs.

"CS Students, how was math 240? There might be a very valid reason that I see so many complaints about Math 240 on this sub, but when I went to school in the early 2010's the Discrete Math courses were not difficult and I rarely heard anyone complaining about them. I did not take them as I took Math 235 and Math 350 (with Norin which was the hardest course I've ever taken), but again Discrete I and II were considered pretty reasonable at the time. What's changed? I've also heard a lot of complaining about Comp 251 (I took 252) and Comp 360, which were generally considered pretty straight forward classes in the early 2010s.

Some theories I have are that:

1. quality of instruction has gone down because of the increasing number of CS students and fairly stagnant number of instructors.

2. The average quality of student has gone down because the number of students has doubled in the past 10 years. 

3. I'm just an old geezer who likes to shit on the younger generation and reminisce on the glory days.

"Replacing Econ 257: Economic Statistics In pre covid times I went to talk to the Honours Econ advisor about replacing Econ 257 with Math 356/357.

However, I really hated honours math courses so instead I wanna take math 323 and 324. 

A few days ago I emailed the same honours econ advisor mentioning this, but he said that I have to take Econ 257 in order to complete the requirements for the honours program. I found this rather strange because on McGill’s website (https://www.mcgill.ca/economics/files/economics/rules_statistics_courses_201909.pdf) it says “Students who have completed MATH 203 and 204 (or MATH 323 and 324 or MGCR 271 and MGSC 372, or other equivalent statistics courses in other departments listed in the Faculty's Course Overlap) do not have to complete ECON 257D and will be exempted from ECON 257D.” 

So my question is do I have to listen to the advisor or can I take 323/324 instead of 257?",0

What do I plan to do in case I don't pass it? I wouldn't even be considered a full time student if I fail the placement exam and end up taking 3 courses in my first term. Also, it would waste a lot of my time.

"I need advice I’m currently in U1 psychology (B.Sc), I took BIOL 200, PSYC 211, PSYC 213, COMP 202 and PSYC 305.

I’ve been enjoying all my courses for the most part. COMP 202 is definitely my favourite so far, I enjoy studying for it, listening to the lectures and I genuinely have fun making random little programs for fun with what we learn in class.

PSYC 213, on the other hand, is definetly my least favorite. I hate how much seemingly useless info (in my opinion) there is to memorize. There’s so much content because they’ll give you like 10 theories about one thing that can all be tested on, but then tell you that 8 of those things have been basically proven wrong. But sometimes the prof forgets to say if they’re wrong so you don’t know until someone asks.

For some context, in the past, I’ve been really good at mathematics, they’ve always been my best courses, easy 90s.

I’ve been enjoying PSYC 211 a lot though. I chose PSYC as my major because I was interested in neuroscience and how the brain works (and I couldn’t get into neuro). I was expecting more courses like this, but 213 leaves a really sour taste in my mouth.

Would you recommend switching majors from PSYC to COMP? Are most COMP classes similar to 202 or are they different (I know they’ll be harder)? Also, are the rest of the PSYC courses more similar to PSYC 213 or PSYC 211?

Also, I’m planning on doing a minor in interdisciplinary life science. So the classes I took outside of COMP 202 are all in that minor. Except PSYC 213.",0

"Thoughts on taking Mech 383 in U1 Hello fellow Mechies I was just curious on your opinions on if I should take Mech 383 in Winter of U1. I met with my Advisor today and she said it she could let me register if I wanted.

A little background: I’m an out of province student currently in U1. For winter I’m currently registered for 14 credits

Mech 220
Mech 262
Math 264
Cive 207

I know these courses are hell and that adding something else will mean I’ll have no life next semester but I’m very afraid of my Fall 2022 semester which is

Math 271 
Mech 321
Mech 240
Mech 314
Mech 360
Mech 331

I feel like I will not survive this so I’m trying to get this to 5 courses instead of 6. The advisor and I came up with a plan to achieve that if I take Mech 383 in Winter 2021. 

Lastly, I realize this can be solved if I just take an extra semester but that really isn’t an option as my parents would like me to finish in 4 years and I don’t want to take longer either.

What are your thoughts about taking 383 nest semester?

Thank you for any opinions.",0

So far my courses are PHYS 342 (Majors EM Waves), either COMP 400 or PHYS 479 (Research Project), PHYS 514 (General Relativity), COMP 551 (Applied Machine Learning), and COMP 360 (Algorithm Design).

I'm required to take PHYS 342, a research project, and either a 400+ level COMP course or a 500+ level physics course. I was originally going to take PHYS 514 and 2 easy electives, but a professor has advised me that COMP 360 and COMP 551 are extremely valuable to grad programs in my preferred areas of CS. Unfortunately, COMP 400 and COMP 551 are both 4 credit courses, so that would potentially put me at a 17 credit semester.  I've also always wanted to take GR, so it would suck to drop that.

I'm super interested in the topic but this workload is really intimidating. Is this what all 400 level history classes are like? If so, I'll just stay in this one since it's a topic I find super interesting. If not, would it be worth it to take a class I'm slightly less interested in but that will be more manageable?",0

"Looking for information about summer semesters I was looking to do a 6-credit language course this summer, but I am having trouble finding specific information:

How much do summer courses cost, about?

If I do this, I will be doing 4 class semesters for the following year. Does my tuition cost remain the same or does it cost less to do less classes per semester? 

Also, will more summer classes be opening up, or are the ones currently posted on minerva the only ones which will be available in Summer 2022?

I would like to try a 4 class semester (I suppose I did that in freshman) but open to 5 of course. The benefit of not doing 323 next semester is it’s likely the only course I can do in summer apart from 315.

Also, I have no preference between 303, 302, and 310 in terms of which first. I just took 273 and 250 last semester if that provides any direction. If one helps another, or a specific prof is better then that would also provide some direction.

How does this schedule look? I'm in Computer Science and Biology, and after a miserable 16 credit semester in Fall I'm trying to lessen the load. I know three courses in a row is awful, but the other options (MATH 223, BIOL 202, MATH 323) weren't ideal as well.

I'm pessimistic and expecting Winter 2022 to be fully online, do you think this is doable?

"Poli 450 Online So I signed up for POLI 450 this semester because I had heard that this class has a week-long simulation which sounded really awesome. However, with the winter semester looking to be back online/hybrid, I was wondering if the stimulation would still happen/what would it look like. Has anyone taken POLI450 last year and could tell how it went?

 I did an online simulation with POLI244 in Summer 2020 and it....wasn't great. If it's the same with POLI450, I'm probably gonna switch class. Thanks!",0

I hope the break is going well. 

I am still super torn between between taking biol201 or bioc212 this semester. I am a U1 Pharm major and I've heard that bioc212 is very memorization heavy while biol201 is more conceptual. As well, I've heard that the prof for biol201 is better than the profs of bioc212. I've also heard that bioc212 sets you up better for bioc311, which is a required course for my major; I'm not sure if this is true though.

"JWST 205 with David Aberbach I originally registered for Intro to Jewish Literature with Professor Aberbach when the 'classes under 200 students will be in person' announcement was sent out. I really wanted to have an in person class with a discussion based structure to compensate for my first year and half of online college. It has since been moved online, and the prof sent out some preliminary reading and text excerpts. I read through them, and it actually looks like an interesting class. It would be great if anyone has feedback on Aberbach as a professor, or with this class in particular, to help me decide whether to drop it or not. Also how likely are classes this small going to be moved in person after the 24th (36 students)? I realize that is a difficult question to answer, but any input is appreciated. The class would be an elective, has nothing at all to do with my major, just seems interesting.",0

"MATH 141, MATH 133, and Chemistry Program Requirements So I flat out failed MATH 141, and that means that I have to retake it either next semester or Fall semester of my U1 year, and I don’t want me failing MATH 141 derail anything for getting into the Chem program in the Faculty of Science. Before the fall semester started I arranged to have MATH 141 and then MATH 133 for Fall and Winter respectively. I already have MATH 140 credit through AP Calculus AB testing. Chem program requires that I get these math credits(link below). My issues is that retaking MATH 141 in Winter 2022 is that MATH 141 either conflicts with my other classes or at very strange times that won’t work for me with the schedule I built. I consulted Sam Seawall about the whole thing and he said that it was better to do MATH 141 and then MATH 133 in Fall of my U1 year. Should I keep my original schedule of MATH 133 for Winter 2022 and do MATH 141 in Fall 2022, or talk to my Advisor on what to do? I have PYHS 102, CHEM 120, and BIOL 112 as my other classes. What should I do from here? 

Note: I am not taking the supplemental test since I didn’t have a good understanding of the Calc 2 material.

"EAST 220 (9 credits) and COMP 273 through IUT at Concordia (3 credits) in summer Hello!

I'm interested in taking two classes: 

\- EAST 220 First Level Korean (9 credits, 4 hours of class every weekday, 2.5 months)

\- ""COMP 273 Intro to Computer Systems"" through IUT at Concordia (3 credits, something like two lectures (2h30) and two tutorials (1h40) every week, 1.5 months)

They overlap for the first 1.5 months, and the last month will be only Korean, so I'm hoping that it's doable. What should I be worried about? Should I only stick to one of them to avoid sanity/gpa loss?

Please let me know if you have any experience with those classes, I can't find much information online.

Extra details here to reduce clutter: 

`May 2 - July 14: East 220 has 4 hours of class every day between 9:35 am - 2:35 pm`

`May 2 - June 15: COMP 273 (the actual course code is COMP 228/SOEN 228 System Hardware) should be something like two 2h30 lectures (6:30 pm - 9:00 pm) and two 1h40 tutorials (from 4:40 pm - 6:20 pm) every week`

"Looking to Take Summer Courses at Concordia Question for anyone who might have done the same thing and knows how the process works;

Last fall I had a pretty rough term, failing both Thermodynamics 1 (MECH 240) and Linear Algebra and PDEs (MATH 271). In order to try to catch up on my degree I'd like to take these as summer courses, however given McGill doesn't offer these courses in the summer, I'm looking to take their equivalents at Concordia. In this regard, I have a couple questions:

1- Does Concordia have an equivalent class to MATH 271, if so what is the course code?

2-Would I be applying through the BCI, or do I have to do it though another avenue? 

Thanks for any information.",0

* **POLI 348** Gender and Canadian Politics
* **EDPC 503** Inter. Relationships&amp;Sexuality

The GSFS program also allows students to email the syllabi of courses not listed on the list that relate to gender/sexuality/feminist/social justice studies and they may be approved, so if anyone knows any courses that would fit this description at the 300+ level please let me know.

Just a small question as well for AFE, are 9 credits considered full-time? I have read that on this sub but  also seen 12 so I am confused.

Bio 112 final advice? hello! I am preparing for the Biol 112 final and it just seems like there is endless information to memorize. While I understand this is the (unfortunate) reality of most bio courses I was wondering if anyone who has taken the course before has any advice? They have not provided us with any sample tests :/ Is the content on the final more reflective of the material after the midterm or pretty cumulative? Would anyone happen to know which material is more imperative to study? Thanks!,0

# Preface
Before my U1 year, when I tried to look up some courses in r/McGill about some of my courses, I found quite a few useful resources for some of the classes -- a few others though, not so much. There is also the fact that certain information was not quite up to date, so I think some more recent experience would be more pertinent to students who will have to take (roughly) the same classes as I did last year. I will try to put more emphasis on profs that are confirmed to teach the class next year, since the information would be more relevant.

It is also worth mentioning that I\'m currently doing a joint honours in physics and computer science, although there is significant overlap between pure physics and joint in maths as well.

I will try to provide a review for the professor as well as the course itself.

# Course and Instructor Review
## Maths
### MATH 150/151: Calculus A/B
*Taught by: Charles Roth. Delivery: purely online*

#### Impression

This is the accelerated version of calc 1,2,3; as a result, it is quite a bit more challenging. The naming of the course, in my opinion, should have been \'honours differential calculus\' for 150, and \'honours integral calculus\' for 151, in that 150 teaches all single and multi-variable differential calculus, and 151 does the same but for integral calculus (and the difficulty is appropriately \'honours\' for 100-level). Roth also slips some differential geometry by the end of 151, which is quite tricky. The content goes fast, and although the WebWorks are trivial enough, the assignments are next-level in terms of difficulties, especially when they are from the first courses that one typically does stright out of high school. The exams, however, mimic the assignment to the point that some questions are exactly the same. Try to do the assignments as much as possible.

#### Assessments

In my online year, it consists of WebWorks, two midterms, and a final. The WebWorks are purely computational and quite trivial, the midterms and final were pretty assignment based, but reasonably difficult as he sprinkles weird questions in them.

#### Instructor

As promised, a review for Roth. Despite that his reviews are sometimes favourable, he was absolutely abysmal teaching online. His 480p webcam does not do a good job capturing his flipboard, and the colour coding he uses is indistinguishable. Moreover, he is very biased towards people who like his class -- if you send him emails about criticism of his class, it might not end well for you. Fortunately though, his exams are usually quite fair so long as you do all the assignments. The lectures are not necessary, given that I did not go to any of his lectures across the three Roth classes that I took.

Also -- if you did not go to classes, don\'t miss the tutorials. They are actually quite helpful in my experience.

### MATH 235: Algebra 1
*Taught by: Daniel Wise. Delivery: online lectures, in person assessments*

#### Impression

This is the introduction to proofs class in McGill, which happens to also be intro to groups, rings, and number theory. The content is very difficult, but is hands down one of the most interesting classes that I have ever taken. There\'s just something about the way of thinking involved in abstract algebra that draws me into it, about how surprising and how satisfying some of the theorems are. The course starts with a bit of number theory and some elementary stuff, and it quickly evolves into group theory, which is the majority of the class. Ring theory only takes like a week or two in the end, but Dani crams so much content in this unit that you absolutely should not overlook this. In my opinion, albeit all the fun, the course teaches too much content for it to be a comfortable course for everyone. It sort of makes sense, however, since despite no honours in the name, it is a course that all honours students take.

Now, although I\'m quite a fan of Dani Wise, I will have to say that he did not do much at all this year in the name of course delivery. We only had recordings of online lectures, which are actually reuploads of the *exact* lectures that he had given last year. Plus, during the lectures, he sometimes pauses for quite a while trying to figure out why things are not working out for him in his computations (it is usually result of typos). He could have re-recorded those bits so he wouldn\'t waste our time as well.

#### Assessments

Although our year has fully online lectures, all the formal assessments are in person. The assignments in this class are weekly and relatively time consuming, especially for a first proof course. Nevertheless, they force your hand to ensure that you stay at the top of your game. The two midterms are one final are fair, I would say. The final was quite difficult; I would not be surprised by a failing average, in fact. However, he definitely has employed a generous curve in the end.

#### Instructor

Apart from the aforementioned laziness and epic curve, he is actually really accessible outside of class. He had a course FB group where he answered questions very promptly, and he also gave one-on-one tutoring sessions for people who emailed him, basically. He is also very passionate for the subject, which in my experience makes an instructor good.

**Note:** taken as substitute for MATH 240.

**Note 2:** although the explicit prerequisite for COMP 251/252 is MATH 240, you really would not be disadvantaged if you take this instead. So long as you know basic compinatorial stuff you are golden.

### MATH 247: Hons. Applied Linear Algebra
*Taught by: Tim Hoheisel. Delivery: purely online*

#### Impression

Do not let the course name fool you. It says applied, but it is really, really theoretical. Maybe not as abstract-algebraic as MATH 251, but definitely leaps and bounds more theory-focused than 223 and 236. The course material itself is quite interesting in my opinion. Since the course is geared towards physics and applied maths people, it may do the course good to have more actually \'applied\' stuff in here, but I suppose it is an honours maths course at the end of the day. It covers basically everything there is to teach about undergraduate linear algebra (except from dual spaces, multilinear forms, and Jordan canonical forms off the top of my head), and it teaches them to a sufficient depth, where every statement is appropriately proven.

#### Assessments

There are eight (or nine) graded assignments, with a midterm and a final. The assignments were tough, but don\'t be afraid to talk to the TA about it -- they will help you as much as they could. The midterm grade can be dropped if you did bad, which I think it\'s the majority here (doing bad, I mean). The final was fair and more computational. Overall, the assessments were fair. It was taken online though, so in person might be a different story.

#### Instructor

I personally love Hoheisel. He's a more theorem-lemma-proof kinda guy, which can mean that his lectures are a bit dry; nevertheless, he has a unique German sense of humour that I do appreciate. Speaking of theorem-lemma-proofs, he has a completely type-set notes using LaTeX of the whole course, which is pure gold. Out of class he is also quite approachable; he will try his best to help you through any confusion.

**Note:** the course was taken online, so YMMV.

### MATH 249: Hons. Complex Variables
*Taught by: Anush Tserunyan. Delivery: purely in-person*

#### Impression

The smol boi version of MATH 466, but is still very much an honours maths class. Everything is still substatiated by proofs, and it build all the way from the fundamentals to the residue theory. There is one thing that I don't like about the course though: since this course is geared primarily towards honours physics students, analysis is not actually a prerequisite for the class. This decision makes the course in a sort of in-between limbo; on the one hand, it still has maintain some rigour, but on the otherhand the students might not understand anything. This forced the prof to make a lot of digressions so that we would have a better understanding. Complex analysis is very fun, but not my favourite course.

#### Assessments

We were assessed by five assignments, a miderm, and a final. The assignments were more proof-based although not terribly difficult; plus, the lowest grade got dropped. The midterm and final were more computational than proof based, with some conceptual questions thrown in as well. The assessments were quite fair.

#### Instructor

Prof. Tserunyan stated herself that she has never taught complex analysis before, but overall it actually went very well. Since she is well-versed in real analysis, she would give us digressions that try to help us understand the course better. She is also very accessible outside of class. One downside is though she is not very organised. Her notes are sometime not the most legible, and at times she jumps around content a bit because she forgets some pretext. Overall a very nice prof.

### MATH 314: Advanced Calculus
*Taught by: Charles Roth. Delivery: online lectures, in-person assessments*

#### Impression

What can I say. Just move everything that I have written for MATH 150/151 here and slap on vector calculus and we're golden. Except... It's not that simple; our dear Charles Roth has also slipped in a month-long intro to partial differential equations unit at the end, which, by the way, did not account for the feelings of students who never took ODEs at all. Imagine my horror of studying the whole unit in five days before the exam (that's more on me tbh). Anyhow, not much to say here; the course goes a bit slower than 150/151, but it feels like a natural continuation of it. You will encounter sometimes the same assignment examples in 314 that you have seen in 150/151, which hits you fresh with nostalgia and PTSD. The advice is also exactly the same here: do the assignments.

#### Assessments

We had WebWorks, one midterm and a final. WebWorks were harder than 150/151 but still relatively free-marks. The midterm and final were once again heavily assignment-based.

**Note:** taken as replacement for MATH 248: Hons. Vector Calculus.

**Note 2:** impression for Roth is the same as before.

### MATH 325: Hons. ODEs
*Taught by: Tsog Gantumur. Delivery: purely in-person.*

#### Impression

Gotta say, I don't love this course. Maybe cos I think calculus is pretty boring, but I never really enjoyed much of it. The course is heavily memorisation based since we were not allowed any crib sheets. Being an 8:30 class didn't help much with the attendence, either; myself for one did not go for more than three lectures, and the instructor's voice made me sleepy as well. Fortunately, the textbook (Boyce Di Prima) was quite good. The bad thing though, was that Gantumur being the chad who only teaches grad PDE and functional analysis, teaches the ENTIRETY of the thicc book, bar Sturm-Liouville and numerical solutions. He even did Floquet theory, which I still don't get what it actually is. My advice is to stay on track with the readings

#### Assessments

We had WebWorks, four written assignments, one miderm and a final. The WebWorks are easy if you are relatively up to date on the materials, the written assignments less so -- you would want to look at his notes to figure out his approach to properly deal with them. The midterm was easy, but the final was very challenging in my opinion. It was 3 conceptual with 2 computations, but they were reasonably difficult, which I guess was why a curve was needed in the end.

#### Instructor

Gantumur is, I'm sure, a good prof for grad studies, in that he explains concepts relatively clearly with reasonable depth. However, he just isn't engaging enough to make a boring (imo) subject less boring. I've also never engaged with him outside of class, so I genuinely don't know enough here to give a judgement.

## Physics
### PHYS 251: Hons. Class. Mech. 1
*Taught by: Jim Cline. Delivery: in-person lectures, online assessments*

#### Impression

A truly magnificent class, the first class that gives you a glimpse of the secrets of our universe. We learnt about how to estmiate the age/size of the universe, how to use Lagrangians to estimate seemingly impossible cosmological parameters, and many things else. It is truly unfortunate that Jim Cline taught us this class though (more on this later). In my opinion, the difficulty is night-and-day compared to PHYS 131. We actually need to use non-trivial calculus and linear algebra in this class, and we derived important concepts and equations from the ground up. A really good class in my opinion.

#### Assessments

We have participation, 10 assignments, one midterm and a final. The difficulties though are out of this world.
Every assignment took me over 10 hours, and that's with dozens of students in the class working together. The midterm and final questions look like they came straight out of McGill's PhD entrance exam, which is saying something... There were hefty (30-40%) curves in the end though, since the average was around 30% for both exams...

#### Instructor

It's bloody incredible, how Cline handled our class. He's really not good at teaching; although he has his inspiring moments, the disorganised teaching and illegible notes made learning very difficult. He also made the course extremely challenging for a first year class. I would not recommend him for any course, given how PHYS 567 ppl also found him abysmal.

### PHYS 241: Signal Processing
*Taught by: Walter Reisner. Delivery: purely in-person*

#### Impressions

A pretty decent class. Not too difficult, and not too boring. I've never liked electronics and signal processing that much, but I have to admit that the class is quite useful. The lectures are quite optional in my opinion; the prof has pretty good slides to study from (although according to Minerva Reisner is not teaching it next year). The labs were decently easy, pretty much guaranteed good marks if you follow the *exact* instructions from the grading rubric and lab manual.

#### Assessments

We had five assignments, a midterm, a final, and four labs. The assignments and the labs were pretty easy marks if you stay on top of your game (i.e., if you don't procrastinate until you have to rush it the last minute). The midterm and the final were both of fair difficulty, and since the midterm grade can be dropped, there's pretty much no stake for the desperate crammers to leave the course until the last minute before the final to grind (I don't recommend that, obviously).

#### Instructor

Reisner is not teaching it next winter, so I guess it's kind of a useless review here. But he's a very nice guy, genuinely caring to his students. I myself had a administrative issue on my midterm, and I had tried to go to his office outside of his office hours. He was busy working, but after my (polite) ask, he was very eager to help me sort out the issue. Kudos to the guy.

### PHYS 257/258: Experimental Methods I &amp; II
*Taught by: Brigitte Vachon &amp; David Cooke. Delivery: purely in-person*

#### Impressions

They are not different enough to talk about separately. If I were to describe the course, I'd call them the necessary evil (as someone who likes theory more), since they do introduce essential tools for physicists to utilise in everyday life. My number one recommendation is that one should learn Python and LaTeX as early as possible. Despite that LaTeX does not become the rigid requirement until the second lab of PHYS 258, every TA that I have encountered gave hefty bonuses for using LaTeX in our group's report. Python (and proficiency in `numpy`) is extremely beneficial all around though.

The biggest warning that I will issue is that the although the course is not difficult, it is *extremely* time consuming. Every lab takes like 10 hours or thereabouts in total, which given weekly is quite a huge chunk of time carved out of your schedule. Please start early on your reports.

257 has a final exam, but since Vachon is still teaching it this fall, I'd bet that it would not be difficult -- it will basically be the exact same type of Q's as the practice. 258 has a final project; I'd say choose the topic early, do it as best as you can, and write the report up as professionally as you can, and you will get a good grade.

Lectures are mostly statistical methods. Feel free to skip them, but read the slides as they sometimes contain important announcements.

#### Assessments

257 has eight labs and a final, whilst 258 has six labs and a final project. The harshness of the grading is strongly dependent upon the TA that is assigned to grade your work, so it's more of a luck-of-the-draw situation here. My biggest advice is to make your presentation as good as possible -- a good LaTeX template and concise narrative can go a long way.

#### Instructors

Both instructors are pretty good. They make the class quite engaging, and they would also sprinkle in stories from their own research to give some more context to the teaching. Not much outstanding to say here, given that I barely attended the lectures to be perfectly honest.


## Computer Science
### COMP 208: Intro to Programming (for Physical Sciences)
*Taught by: Chad Zammar. Delivery: purely online.*

#### Impression

The course that made me embark in the joint honours. This is my first introduction to programming and computer science, and I'd say that the difficulty is just right. It wasn't overwhelming, and by the time I exited the course, I had a pretty solid grasp on Python. I heard that the course had a pretty big overhaul after Chad stopped teaching it though, so I don't think I'll say too much about the course here. I would have recommended my iteration of the course.

#### Assessments

iirc, we had four assignments, two quizzes, and a final. The assignments were quite challenging, but also nurture your programming skills to a large degree. We were asked to thoroughly comment our code, and we were marked heavily on that. The quizzes and final were not hard, as it was open book, but they were annoying in that some questions ask us to code on mycourses quiz widgets. Extremely hard to keep track of the syntax there, but that's my only complaint.

#### Instructor

He has moved on to industry (still teaches intro to C++ though I think), but Chad is a real Chad. Very funny guy, intelligent, is not afraid to try for a long time just to answer your questions. Everyone I know loves him.

### COMP 250: Intro to CS
*Taught by: Mike Langer. Delivery: purely in-person*

#### Impression

Given that Langer basically build the course from ground up, it's no surprise that 250 is a very mature course by now. The first half of the course is on Java as a programming language (and OOP as a paradigm), and the second half of the course is on algorithms and data structures. In my opinion, the first and second half of the course demand seperate ways of thinking. The first half is similar to COMP 208/202, which is programming-heavy, and the second half is more actually-computer-science. I think many people underestimates the latter half of the class, and it often does not end up well for them in the end. In my opinion, watching YouTube videos on how the algorithms and DS's really work helps a lot here.

Oh, and also, DON'T CHEAT. It's so easy to get caught, so might as well just don't. Discussing ideas with friends is fine; copying is a big no-no.

#### Assessments

We had four assignments, five quizzes, and a final. The assignments were time consuming, but so long as you start early you are pretty much getting a high grade. The quizzes were not very easy; you have to remember some quite nitty-gritty stuff to do well in them. The final is the kicker here, because of the infamous 'no pass final, no pass course' policy. Personally, I feel that the final is easy to pass if you satisfy one of the following: 1. you are good at Java; 2. you are good at algo/DS; 3. you are decent-ish with both. I personally only had four hours in total to study for the course since I had three exams in the three previous days to 250, so I got to the Fieldhouse remembering nothing about Java. Fortunately though, I was solid in the latter half of the course, so I scored well on the final.

#### Instructor

Langer is great. He's good organisationally, good with answering questions, decently humorous, decently engaging, and overall good at delivering classes to big hordes. Take it with him, you won't really regret it.


### COMP 252: Hons. Algorithms &amp; Data Structures
*Taught by: Luc Devroye. Delivery: purely in-person*

#### Impression

Legendary course taught by legendary professor. No honours compsci experience is complete without this baptism of a class. I'll be real here -- as a not-too-good-at-comp-sci person, the course was extremely difficult for me, and because of Luc's eccentricity and sometimes erratic nature, it felt not as organised. However, I personally have friends that absolutely adores him as a prof and 252 as a class (also someone who dislikes them). Back to the course itself. I think it's quite well designed; although people would lament upon the fact that there is no programming, implementations are things that can be found online. The initial understanding, however, is invaluable, and Luc will give you that here. We basically covered everything there is to cover for algorithms and data structures, and all lectures are actually scribed via LaTeX (by the previous students of the class), and notes are posted on Luc's website, so I would recommend you to sit back and absorb as much as you can during class without taking notes, and read the high-quality scribe notes at home.

The topics taught were outlandishly broad. In fact, disregarding depth (which is also not ignored, of course), I wouldn't be surprised if he taught us most of the data structure that would appear on grad-level information structure classes. This, of course, made the exams difficult...

#### Assessments

We had six assignments, a midterm and a final. The assignments are purely theoretical. In fact, they look more like maths than compsci (which makes sense, I suppose). The midterm was designed to be a wake up call, in that it does not weigh much (8%), but he absolutely destroyed people who were not ready and were still in their sweet dreams back in 250 (myself included). The final, on the other hand, was hard but fair. It was broad, but not too hard to pass -- he gave everyone a 30% curve in the end to top it off as well.

#### Instructor

Luc is a truly inspiring person. He might be one of the smartest people in this university, yet he is humorous, humble, and easy to approach. In his office hours, everyone sits on his couches to chat with him, and he cracks a lot of jokes during class about some really famous people in computer science that he has had personal interactions with. Some people might dislike him for his teaching style -- and that's absolutely fair, I myself was not the biggest fan. But I would not deny the fact that he is a good prof.

# End Word

I plan to double major in CS and stats at the faculty of arts; these degrees have some overlap in courses.

Will I have to take the required stats courses and substitute the complementary CS courses.

"Waiver for pre-requisite? Dear all,

I registered for GEOG 333, as I would like to gain some applied programming skills. However, I didn't take GEOG 201, and I had to take them both to register for GEOG 333, thus blocking three credits for a class I don't want to take.

For now, it's not a problem at all, as the other classes I would prefer have ample room remaining.

The thing is, I feel taking GEOG 201 would be a dire investment of credits. I already use extensively GIS in my job, and thus I don't think it will be useful to me. Yeah, I would get an easy A, but I would like to invest those credits in other skills. Also, people surely need GEOG 201 more than I do

Thus, has one of you had/heard someone got the requirement waived (like for a class with blocked registration)? If I get the approval from the prof, can I ask the faculty to remove the block? I even don't feel GEOG 201 is that important for GEOG 333, as the latter rather emphasizes programming over GIS (thus why you can take them in parallel)

"ECON 468 and ECON 337 Dear McGillians,

I have mixed feelings about the utility of taking ECON 468:

I know that ECON 468 is unbelievably hard (although Davidson isn't teaching it this year), but I'm not sure about the utility of going through this class. I will be taking MATH 423 and ECON 420 with Davidson next fall (linear algebra intensive), so I believe they will give me positive feedback knowledge to help me with it.

For those who took it, would you say it teaches you knowledge that is very applicable and has a real value-added? This is why I'm also interested in ECON 337, which teaches you advanced panel data and times series, which can be very useful.

In conclusion, is it worth risking failing ECON 468, or ECON 337 is complete enough?

Yours sincerely,

(Ps: Also I'm not in honours ECON, thus I don't require 468)",0

Prof nadarajah started here last year, but he has what seems like a bit of a.. scary(?) proportion of 1 star reviews from his time at uoft (exceeding all other ratings combined) and few mcgill reviews so far, so I'm wondering if anyone here had him last year and how it was (even if it was another course with him)?

I'm not in a math related major and only have math 141 and math 203 under my belt from a while ago so taking this course scares me a bit bc idk what to expect and it seems like most people that take this course are in cs or stats or something saying it was easy except that the second half gets hard fast. So I was hoping to take the other prof's section (prof sajjad) who I've heard good things about, but I've yet to make her section work for my schedule and Nadarajah's section in the winter works better.

*""Laws of demand, supply, returns, and costs; price and output determination in different market situations""*

&amp;#x200B;

The class is usually very maths-heavy and is when calculus is first applied to economic concepts. Does anyone know if there is such a class available at McGill and how I could find out if it's available during the Winter Semester 2023? 

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's a lot of information, but even a starting point would be useful. I've tried using the catalogue system on Horizon but it's confused me a little bit lol.  

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much!",0

I am deeply interested in taking the Introduction to Finance MGCR 341 course this Fall semester.

I want to take MGCR 341 lecture 002 courses this Fall semester but unfortunately, I was disappointed to discover the course MGCR 341 as Lec 002 is already full.

"Is it a bad idea to skip MATH 140 through the placement test? For context, I am an incoming U0 student going into ChemE who took their provincial gr 12 calculus course along with IB math AA SL. I signed up for the placement test thinking I knew most of the concepts of the course and hoping to go straight to MATH 141 in the fall.

In preparation for the test, I am going through the textbook used for MATH 140 and I am realizing that many of the proofs/derivations showing why the rules in calculus actually work (or where they come from) were not covered in my high school calculus course. Seeing this has made me question my choice in skipping MATH 140 for a few reasons.

1. Would I have to know these proofs/derivations for the placement exam?
2. Would not knowing these proofs/derivations come to bite me in the back in subsequent calculus courses?
3. Hence, should I learn all those proofs/derivations to prepare for the exam? Or is just knowing how to apply the concepts in calculus enough?

UPDATE: thanks for all the responses, they were very reassuring to hear! I will move forward with taking the placement exam!",0

"Psyc 300+ course recommendations? Hey, does anyone have some recommendations for 300+ level psyc courses? I'm currently taking Psyc 332 with Koestner. He's a really good prof and lectures are interesting. But  I heard that in the exam he's going to test you on really detailed things from lectures and readings (he actually also showed a comedy to demonstrate personalities of characters and I really don't want to memorize all these stuff... plus the second season of the comedy will open on Sep 21st, so much more things to memorize?). I also have several 500+ Comp courses and comp 400, so I'm kind of worrying about the course load. I'm ok with hard course material, but really don't want tough exams...

"MGSC 404 Foundations of decision analytics Hi,

I am a U2 student pursuing a double major in Econ and CS and came across this course (MGSC 404). I have no idea about the difficulty level and if it is considered a very difficult course that would require a lot of time. I know it uses Python which I have done before so I am comfortable with that but is this course very programming heavy and what's the difficulty level like since it is a 400-level course?

Would appreciate any suggestions! Thanks!",0

"Comp 250 or Comp 202 This is my first term at McGill. 

I accidentally registered for both and need to drop one. I don’t know which one to drop though. I have experience with python and I know most of what’s on the syllabus, so I was hoping it might be a bit of a breather/python refresher as I settle to uni workload and rhythm, especially in math courses that I’m worried I’ll get overwhelmed in. After some sleuthing it seems to be more work than anticipated, and so maybe not worth it given that I know the material and it’s not strictly necessary to my degree. 

I’m worried about the workload and unknown material of 250 though, and the potential too-high difficulty of the course.

2. I need a few **200-500 level** electives (please don't say CHEM 181 lol). I'd love to take a philosophy or music course but I'm so desperate for anything right now I just need something interesting and passable. 
3. Thoughts on COMP 202 or Faten M'Hiri? I have taken high school CS in the past so I don't think it's a lot of new material but I've also seen a lot of really bad reviews for the class and cannot find much on the professor.

"MATH 338 Worries Is anyone worried about the way MATH 338 is being taught this year? I'll preface this by saying I am not a math or physics or CS major, so this might make sense and only apply to me, but I always thought this class was a relatively ""easy"" math class and that even arts students could take it (there were nopreqs listed before this semester). Historically, the averages have been high and all the posts about it on this sub say it is an easy class, but I have been finding Dr. Fortier a little difficult to follow. By no means did I take this class as an easy A elective, I am very interested in the material, but it seems like it has been much more proof-based and pure math than History or Philosophy of Math. As someone who hasn't taken a math class since an introductory linear algebra class in CEGEP, this is a little worrying. I am sure the class is very easy for anyone with a math background, but I am wondering if there are any other non-math students in the same situation as me. Maybe this is all in my head, any insight would be helpful!",0

"Overlapping Stats Courses Posted this bit as a reply to someone, but wanted to repost for more views/comments. 

I'm U0 so don't have an advisor and am interested in ECON major.

I'm planning to take ""Introduction to Psychological Statistics. - PSYC 204 - 001"" next semester but it says that ""You may not be able to receive credit for this course and other statistic courses"". For ECON major it says that ECON 227 is required and seems like PSYC 204 is not eligible as a replacement.

I don't understand though if I take the Psyc 204 in my U0 year and later decide that I want to be an ECON major am I SOL? Am I simply not allowed to take the ECON because I took the PSYC? I don't understand the course overlap thing and it's stressing me out!",0
"MATH 463 Convex Optimization Hi
I am considering to take this class next semester, however it is in conflict with MATH 308, which I also wanted to take. 

I would like to ask, what is convex optimization useful for?  Should I choose it over Math 308? 

I do wish to study / work in data science later on, I saw that convex optimization is used in data modelling, especially optimal experimental design, on the other hand Math 308 is obviously super important for statistics.  Therefore I am hesitant about which one to take. 

Also prof for Math463 is Paquette Courtney, is she a good prof in general? 

Thank you!",0
GEOG 314 without GEOG 201? Hi! I'm planning on minoring in Urban Studies so GEOG 314 (Geospatial Analysis) is one of the courses I could take for credit. I took GEOG 210 (Global Places &amp; Peoples) last year and would be taking GEOG 317  (Cities in the Modern World) at the same time but I don't think those courses would be very helpful for this course. 201 (Introductory Geo-Information Science) is listed as a prereq which tbh does sound like you'd gain a good basis for 314 but I just don't think I have the time in my schedule to take 201 first. Do people who've taken 314 (and 201) think it would be possible to get by without 201?,0

Dr. Denis gave us the 2020 final exam, but this one was online (open book, etc.) so I don't know how it compares to how it is supposed to be in person. There were questions that were very detail-oriented and even one where you had to read a paper to answer, which makes sense if you have your notes. Any insight from someone who has taken the exam in person (maybe 2019, or 2021?) would be greatly appreciated. I know we're not supposed to be learning the pathways by heart, but we should know the rate-limiting enzyme for each major pathway? From what the prof has told us, there won't be any questions asking to describe in detail a pathway like glycogen synthesis, but more so what would happen to glycogen synthesis if we eat a certain food or take a drug that inhibits a certain enzyme/receptor. Is this a fair view of the exam? Again, any insight would be greatly appreciated!

Heard that the final exam in the past was actually easier than assignments but it seemed to have become much more comprehensive this term.",0

"Could NUTR 207 be triggering? I'm in the ecological determinants of health program that requires NUTR 207, but I'm nervous because I've struggled a lot with my relationship with food. Has anyone with disordered eating/an eating disorder had experience with NUTR 207? I'm worried it could be triggering, but I think it also could be enlightening (giving me the facts about nutrients and not just diet culture).

Thanks in advance!! :) Happy Holidays

edit: I did talk to my advisor about replacing the course if the content could be triggering. They escalated the concern but apparently the degree advisors said they couldn't do that :(",0
